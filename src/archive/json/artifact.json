        "Adventurer's Bandana": "There is nothing special about this green bandana, save that the fabric is rather robust and highly absorbent. Just like the bandana, its wearer was an unexceptional, ordinary person. But countless secrets lie hidden in the stars high up above and the abyss deep down below. All of these things are awaiting discovery by mere mortals.",
        "Adventurer's Flower": "The ambitious adventurer came across this resilient flower in the depths of a gloomy ruin. Moved by the sight of life sprouting in defiance of a lifeless land, he almost forgot about the treasures buried deep in the ruin. After pausing to ponder it for a while, the adventurer plucked the flower, wore it as a brooch, and ventured forth into the darkness.",
        "Adventurer's Golden Goblet": "An old golden goblet that the adventurer used to drink water. It is said that he found it in an old ruin. The exterior is engraved with ancient symbols and inlaid with a faded gemstone. Eventually, the adventurer bid farewell to the nomadic lifestyle. This old golden goblet was traded in for new, shiny Mora.",
        "Adventurer's Pocket Watch": "A pocket watch that once belonged to an adventurer. It was crafted by a master watchmaker with simplicity and practicality in mind, aligning with the philosophy of the Adventurers' Guild. The adventurer spent most of his days in darkness. The rhythmic sound of its moving hands was the only proof he had of the passage of time. Long after he had grown accustomed to a normal life, having given up the adventurer lifestyle he once loved so dearly, this forgotten pocket watch still sat quietly in the cabinet, waiting for its next adventure.",
        "Adventurer's Tail Feather": "An adventurer once traveled through a forest in search of rare beasts never seen before. As he tore his way recklessly through the foliage, the adventurer tripped on a tree root. When he regained consciousness, he saw a girl so beautiful that he was willing to give up the adventurer's life to be with her. Her appearance was surreal, with a cluster of feathers adorning her hair."

They say that in ancient times , when the world was in turmoil, Rex Lapis uprooted mountains to create a giant bird of prey. The bird was carved out of rock and jade , and it soared above the ground the moment it had taken shape. Spiraling toward the heavens, it pierced through the clouds and flattened many stone peaks therein.

There is a folk saying that goes thus: In times of yore, someone told the Lord of Geo that there was no life to be found in barren stone. Thus did the Lord of Geo command flowers of purest gold to burst forth from the face of an uneven rock. Perhaps the Geo Archon did once work such a great wonder. Or perhaps this is but one of the many tales that shroud this ancient world. But the prosperous harbor that grew out of the lifeless mountains, And that braves the raging waters of the Sea of Clouds\u2014 Perhaps that was the brilliant flower, after all.",

Over the passage of time, this sundial came to be the prized possession of Kunwu , who was then still a scholar in training. When I was young, I dreamed of studying the classics and going to Sumeru to attain the greatest wisdom.\" \"Yet when gaining this dial, I played with and examined it for many long days, and could not find in it a single flaw.\" \"Thus I changed tacks and sought a master craftsman to learn a new trade, and thereby challenge the creator of this divine tool.\""

Donning his winter crown, he marched purposefully away, disappearing into the boundless snowstorm. Bearing his agreement with the mountain city, bearing their clear-eyed gazes, the hero never once feared the unknown beyond the icy curtain. The once-lush mountainside and the blessings that now no longer fell from the skies \u2014 these were the hero's motivation to carry on no matter what. \"Past the ice-sealed door, walking down the corridors to the depths,\" \"He will break off a branch of silver-white, and bring hope to the snowy land.\" The maiden sang these songs to comfort her people, and she nursed her memories of him. She believed that he would return to her, with genial springtime and unshakeable hope in his train. But in the end, the hero who stepped out into the snow would not return in time. He would stand accused of flight by hateful words long ground to dust amid the snowstorms...",

Drinking bitter wine in this glass would feel like swallowing icicles that stung every inch of one's throat. Ordinary people would struggle to enjoy this sensation \u2014 but the reticent hero relished it. He was a warrior as silent as the ice itself, blocking the frigid winds that descended from the stars with his body. But not content with merely being protected, the maiden who painted left the man she admired these last instructions: \"If fear or despair, both of which are within our nature, should crush you, or cause you to never return, then...\" \"...Then please, live on. Do not accompany us unto our doom \u2014 to languish forgotten in the snow.\" Taking another swig of bitter wine to steel himself for the journey, he turned away from the maiden's wet eyes, And he would set out on an unending pursuit, towards the land of snow and profundity.",

Even the coldest winter cannot freeze the flow of time. \"The cold that descends from the sky can freeze time itself.\" This myth was widely believed throughout the entombed mountain city . As the hero reached the top of the wall of wind and ice, the night was descending and the snowstorm was howling. Neither sun- nor moon-light could pierce this white wind easily. Even the bleakest storm cannot freeze the river of time. That will not wilt even if buried deep below the snow. And even the most formidable hero will one day be forgotten.",
        "Icebreaker's Resolve": "A feather of a bird of prey that did not originally belong in the winter chill. It is cold to the touch. And when you do touch it, it is as if you can hear cries in the snowstorm, unbowed but bereft of hope. With no nest or shelter, the bird faced the storms proudly. This feather has been assailed with coalescing ice and snow, leaving it coated in pearls of frost. It once came from a falcon in flight and was plucked violently from that bird by the frigid winds. It drifted a while in the air before the weight of the frost dragged it back down to the ground. \"I believe that the lively birds will follow you, and return to the gardens of the summer palace, now green once more.\" \"Those who have been chased away by the chilling tide, and those children who have lost their homes, they will return with you to the home of their dreams.\" The hero , bearing such great burdens on his back, halted in the whipping snow, struggling to discern the color of that feather. Sealed in ice, that feather's color faded every step of the way \u2014 just like the hero's task.",

Your likeness will forever remain on this wall.\" \"For the sake of that fresco, and for everyone's sake, I will pray for you, and wait for your return...\" The maiden stood before a blank wall, and smiling, she pinned a small flower to the hero 's breast. That was an elegant and unruffled fellow, who would never bat an eyelid, not even in the face of death itself. The heroism of the Icebreaker was forgotten, buried in the storms of the North. Since then, the snow has melted \u2014 but this flower has not withered."

In the end the Bloodstained Knight could no longer tell whether the blood that stained him was his own or that of his enemies. Eventually, on his long journey filled with bloodshed, he came to a realization: His path of so-called chivalry had turned him from the white knight he used to be into the monster he had now become. His only followers were the ravens drawn to the bloodshed he left in his wake.",

At an end was the Bloodstained Knight's story, for he realized there was no place for him on this earth. He ventured into the fallen ancient kingdom , and died in battle in the monsters' lair.

With his slingshot he chased boars, and with sturdy branches he would battle imaginary monsters. Following the shining Seelie deep into the woods, he discovered a treasure that had laid buried for a thousand years. The treasure was a small yellow flower.

Many years later, when the cataclysm came, he led the knights to fight for his homeland.

One cycle was the time required to finish her study at the Akademiya . By the time the countdown ended and she returned to her hometown, its previous owner had become a casualty of the crisis. Her maiden years were over. The Crimson Witch of Flame was born, and with her the era of destruction. The timepiece bore witness to the days of monsters and the pain they caused, until all were burned away.",

Though her fires only touched monsters and demons, People still cowered behind closed windows and tried to drive her away. But none of that mattered to her. New hopes were birthed from the fires of old pains. She needed not comforting nor sympathy. Chirping by her side, the birds gave her all the understanding she needed.",

A crisis centuries ago dashed all hope of the maiden seeing the future promised to her. Those dear to her, her past days, and her bright future. All gone. From the ashes, the Crimson Witch of Flame was born, and she burned away her pain with fire. Yet this flower stayed resilient, soft, and moist. Perhaps both painful and beautiful memories were two sides of the same coin.",

The Crimson Witch of Flame walked upon the earth, burning monsters into cinders. Rumor told of how she sacrificed her mortal body to become the embodiment of liquid fire herself. Still, love and longing once dwelt in her maiden heart. Until fires burned away that beautiful and fragile part. Thus, she became the witch that historians were loath to remember.",
        "Witch's Scorching Hat": "A traditional witch's pointed hat with a large brim. It grants a witch the reverence and fear which she commands. To the Crimson Witch of Flame , this large hat shielded her from surrounding distractions. It was how she was able to hone her Pyro skills when she was still an apprentice. In combat, she needed not pay attention to monsters disintegrating in flames. Nor did she need to look at her own burnt face in the water's reflection.

All things that die will gain new life in some other form. All things that decay will sprout pure and tender new shoots. \"But those souls who had been destroyed by death, memories that are eternally lost,\" \"Is there a place for them in the cycle of life and death?\" \"The soul is a void concept, and memories must one day return to the land.\" \"What is there to worry about if something that was always void were to fade away?\" \"Rather, remind and support one another, such that everyone's image will be remembered forever.\" \"Thus shall we defeat the natural cycle of life and death, and preserve memory forever!\" Much later, the friends who had agreed to remind one another would be infected with the wicked disease of forgetfulness. According to the image of the three people and three spirits that had not been wholly forgotten , And the records and conjectures left behind by the mad scientist who was expelled by the academy , The dream had to be captured \u2014 along with the inhabitants of the forest who could control dreams , To remind that friend once again of one's own form and the memories that were shared. If the organ that governs memory has taken too much damage and cannot be healed, Then bring another old friend and dwell in dreams of the past together, Play in a small tree house, and explore the limitless depth of the jungle. Yes, that would be nice as well. For in dreams, everyone has a chance to start over. But first, those dream spirits must be captured. Those sellswords once did much for me. I trust they will not disappoint this time, either.",
        "Labyrinth Wayfarer": "When the lord of the forest was born, the king of trees bestowed upon them a crown. This crown would finally pass to the first maiden who had followed in the lord's footsteps. She once took in many children who had become lost in the forest, yet had not ever trodden upon any wild flowers. She only knew how to serve her liege and defend the labyrinth, And she knew that the world was naught but the dream of the forest, So she taught the ways of the hunt and the method of walking through dreams to the children, She taught that they must love the plants of the forest, for they belong to her liege's garden. That they must respect the creatures that fall under their arrows, for they are her lord's people. Her teachings would pass amongst the lost children of the forest, and they would change much. Eventually, their origins would be forgotten altogether, but some people would become guardians who patrolled the woods, Returning to the world of humans and light bonfires in the deepest of nights to exorcise the shadows. There was one who remained and walked between the trees , eventually forgetting time itself amidst the hunt for wild beasts, becoming drenched in black blood . She was very nearly as ancient as the final lord of the forest, and at the last she dreamed a dream of the labyrinth and the hunt. This dream was so great and vast that it would cover every dream that was ever dreamed by the forest people. The labyrinth, for its part, was the vast and endless hunting ground, where the roots of trees and the lines drawn by the snaking streams were denser than a tiger's stripes, More changeable than the flowing water. The whispers that preach \"death \" became lost within this labyrinth, For only she and those who understood the teachings of the forest lord could pass through the maze and enter into the boundless hunting grounds. Till at last, when the whispers had faded, and the wicked beasts had fled far away, did she, now fully eroded , disappear together with that grand dream. She, and many fragments of dreams, would at last flow into the dreams of human scions. Like how a shattered mirror reflects many different images, The dreams she left behind are circulated through the narratives of the people in a myriad of forms. Those tales that became the widest spread (emerged victorious) had nothing at all to do with her. Her name as mentioned in those tales, for example, was in fact the name of the crown. In the end, all she had left to herself was her true name, a handful of water that reflected the moonlight, And the golden flower she had taken from the crown that her beloved king had given her.",
        "Lamp of the Lost": "It is said that when the lord of folly was destroyed by his own ambition, the kings of the desert arose as one, and fell just as quickly. Many tiny tyrants would marshal refugees fleeing the cataclysm, and they would build temples, palaces, and high walls where once stood ancient ruins. The ruined cities would be devastated each after the next, and despots of all stripes boasting of power and wealth for a time would rise and fall all too quickly. This oil lamp belonged to one of the young princes of the decaying kingdoms and was one of the remaining treasures hidden away in his trove. \" Father ascended the tower in pursuit of a falcon, and the ancient structure could not bear his great weight, casting him into the boiling quicksand.\" \"Thus did our kingdom's days come to be numbered, and I too was dragged into pointless conflicts, tossed this way and that on the waves of treachery.\" \"In those days, I too had someone to love . She longed to be queen, but did not concern herself with the identity of the one seated on the throne.\" \"And so it was that I lost my love. For my life and my seal, I closed her lips with a viper's kiss and buried her in quilts of sand.\" \"Later, just as it happened to all other kingdoms in living memory, threats from without and foes from within would arise. Kith and kin, slaves and pariahs would be at each other's throats.\" \"Scarcity and strife, those two deformed twins, would dance wildly amidst these burning, godless sands, burying our selves within their mirage.\" And so did the kingdom within the searing sand return whence it came, and the once-affluent prince became a penniless refugee. With the wish to conquer new lands burning in his breast, he set out for the rainforest with what little wealth he had left on his person. But much later, the prince who wished to inherit the woodland like a Rishboland Tiger would himself be conquered by the quiet moonlight. He was drawn to the powerful form of the huntress with the white bow , and in being pursued and expelled each night, The homeless prince slowly understood the murmurs of the trees and the whispering of the tigers, and was accepted by the beneficent dream\u2014 \"Hahaha, well, isn't that a fine tale? A noble forced from their home, who finds destiny and glory once again...\" \"Yon golden slumber summons thee, wandering sand...\"",
        "Laurel Coronet": "There is a time appointed for all things to live and die, and the cycle continues on forever, Thus did the ruler of trees once preach the cycle of life. All things that die will gain new life in some other form, And all things that decay will sprout pure and tender new shoots. Fruits that fall upon the land will feed the beasts of the land, And the beasts will return to the land and themselves become fruits. The forests were always full of life. Legend has it that when the god of trees created a forest amidst the sands, The first order of the day was to create a device that could call forth the rains. Thus did the bright moon reflect the patterns of light from the labyrinth upon the water, And from this was the \"tiger\" born. The tiger's stripes were ever-changing, resembling the forest's branches, And thus did it become the ruler of the jungle, whose name was Viaghara . The blessed lord of the forest walked amidst the garden, head held high, Ruling over the primates, the birds, and the beasts of the labyrinth. Later, the seeds of the pomegranates fell upon the soil and gave birth to the forest spirits . Thus did the lord of the forest bless them under the first Vasara Tree , and made a pact with the divine, To share the labyrinth with them, and to command the birds and beasts not to harm them. Though the sun's light was shrouded for a time , the flowing water was once corrupted, And the final forest lord died in defense of the nurseries of life, A large whiskered cat succeeded that regal name, And guarded the woodland creatures in imitation of that lord. Though it could not match even an iota of that lord's might, It would keep the promise and protect the forest, Nor would it ever attempt to harm the guardian spirits of the trees. Yes, though the ever-changing labyrinth has perished, The forest is still filled with life.",
        "Scholar of Vines": "Those were the years of the lord of the labyrinth ... It is said that the most virtuous and visionary of the royal servants was a young girl who could understand the language of all beasts and read the poetry of moonlight. She guarded the silent forest, the still water that embraced the moon, and the endless hunting grounds at the very end of the dream forest. \"We were born in the verdant royal forest. Our world is under the tree-shade and above the meadow.\" \"That which comes from the forest must return to it. As long as we follow the laws of nature, then we shall not fear death.\" \"For all those who follow nature must pass through the maze of the forest and reach that endless plain.\" Her teachings once inspired many children, but like the blood of tigers, it too would slowly grow thin... Those were the years of the ominous moon ... They say that the blind boy followed in the footsteps of his white-armored brother , traversing kingdoms, mountains, and rivers, At last becoming lost in the dark forest. He was obsessed with swordsmanship but was gentler than anyone. He was too dogmatic, but adhered to justice more than anyone... At the end of the everlasting, white phantom in his heart, what he discovered was a relic of the woods , pure white as the moonlight. Later, there came beasts that lusted after flesh and blood. When the huntress finally came to him, following the shimmering light of the white branches, He had already lost the power to make wishes, and the white form that once guided him had faded into darkness and disappeared... Those were the years when the night was on the rise. Those were the years when dawn was still far-off. From the nightmare, the wise caught a glimpse of the dark longsword and the red blooming in the water."

        "Defender of the Enchanting Dream": "Travelers here to sup from the oasis, please heed this man so old and blind. Heed the dirge of Gurabad , heed the enrapturing dreams of King Deshret ... Heed the faithful but broken Jinn , and heed a betrayal between companions. Legend has it that when the Lord of Flowers passed, her countless Jinn turned to serve King Deshret. King Deshret searched in vain for the ancient paradise where the divine needle fell, and there created an eternal oasis ... Among the greatest Jinn was one named Ferigees , granted governance of the oasis by King Deshret. To protect her mistress' slumber, she once used her powers to keep the springs ever-flowing, And so she spread greenery across the desert like stars in the sky, providing sanctuary to folk who had lost their homes... Later, under the guidance of the Jinni Liloupar , the vassal states of the mortal kingdoms built their cities around the \"Eternal Oasis.\" Bearing loyalty to the Lord of Flowers and compassion for the newborn realms, Ferigees decided to make a sacrifice. Disobeying the charge given to her by King Deshret, the great Jinni caged her own body in shackles of frost, Turning herself into a seal in the shape of a crystalline cup, restraining the wrath of the vast sands, guarding the cities of the mortals with her immobile form... \"But there is a season for all things, and thus all things must change. As we lean on each other today, so too will we abandon each other tomorrow.\" \"To lose the freedom which the Jinn are so proud of and a vessel that can partake in joy and love, to feel the diminishment of one's spirit by the day.\" \"The nymph of the water lilies drew mortal kings into her machinations with honey-tinged lies, and the Lord of the Sands sank deep into a dream of madness ...\" \"But I have long been waiting \u2014 always waiting \u2014 in a sleepless dream... Waiting for the King of Sand to fulfill his ancient promise.\" Mind and body festooned with wretched machinery, she awaits the end of her mistress' slumber, Bearing a sullen hope as she silently guards the broken dreams of this empire of sand. Even should the spring be mixed with bitter gravel, even if the oasis is swallowed by sand... Even amidst the eternal pulsing of machines, she listens for the coming of the footsteps that will bring change. \"But, my teachers so sightless, I was born into a slave's chains, and had everything taken from me when I was young...\" \"Might I, abandoned by the fates like the dunes of sand as I was, be worthy of a change in my fortunes?\"",
        "End of the Golden Realm": "Young wanderers, please heed this man so old and blind. Heed the ruins of Gurabad , heed the culmination of a delusional dream... Heed the jewel that shines like a dome of stars, and heed the riven states. Towering spires and golden temples were swallowed by a raging tide, and the halls and palaces became the abodes of the ragged poor... The infuriated mob followed the will of one wearing a brass mask , while those with wisdom proclaimed this happening the \"great plague.\" Gurabad fell to this black plague, and Lord of the Red Sands fell upon the path of self-destruction... Liloupar , born to lilies, found herself repaid with a split soul after falling victim to a plot most insidious, While the vast and fertile kingdoms collapsed into the sands overnight. Tribes and kingdoms began the tumult anew... From there, the people of the desert oases divided themselves into seven states, with the city of sapphires, Tulaytullah , being one of the greatest. \"I think I have lived long enough to bear witness to more than my fair share of short-lived fools and villains...\" \"When I was young, the gilded walls once shrouded the sapphire domes like waves covering the moon.\" \"In the days of my youth, the canals of Tulaytullah shone like a luminous lattice, their lights dueling the moon for dominance.\" \"Now, I have been stripped of sight, and yet I must witness nobles falling to slavery, princes cast down by slave-soldiers...\" \"Now, I can no longer see, and yet I speak of dignitaries assassinating the wise and foreign dancers seizing power...\" \"Nations live and die as if in a drunken dream. The beloved and vile alike are all crushed under the weight of a mill like wheat husks.\" The sapphire sea is wreathed in a fog of lies, which go on to become legends and history\u2014 A general , once the conqueror of countless cities, was left with but a slave to guide the way, While a young slave bore the \"key\" to restoring their homeland... The king who died absurdly because of a hunting falcon was left with bloodied knife marks along his throat, And the dancer who made a vow to the prince cared only for the hatred she felt toward the tyrant... Mortal hands were molded into the shape of a falcon, and the broken Jinni was infused within it. From the cliffs of Gurabad it rose with a cry, sailing past the pitiable desert states... Finally arriving in the hands of gilded descendants, the lost memories flaking off like sand. The man-made feather lay upon a dune, silently proclaiming the end of nations... Through an aged voice, the lost prince recalled the palace burning in his homeland, His master at the time had been a general and a poet, loyal to the tyrant who ruined his nation. All things will have their rewards and repercussions. One was stripped of sight, the other of their throne... All the while, the grinding wheel of fate spun onward, scattering broken hopes across the world.",
        "Legacy of the Desert High-Born": "Merchant sheltering from the storm, please heed this man so old and blind. Heed the past of Gurabad , heed the retribution its people sought for themselves. Heed the newborn nobility and the peasants who dwell beneath the palace... Legends say that when Gurabad rose, the kingdoms of man joined many oases into one. At this time, the scattered tribes and the short-lived states obeyed the will of Ormazd alone. Ormazd took the Lord of the Desert as his lord-patron, constructing palaces and temples to facilitate his worship. Slaves were taken from the tribes, servitude was demanded from states, and sacrifices were required of the cities... The city thrived, and nobles and slaves alike lived in its shade. Peering down from on high at the priests and servants below, scurrying like ants, the Jinni concubine could only sigh mournfully. As an attendant of the Goddess of Flowers , she believed she had chosen the ideal king, but didn't wish for him to be addled by vanity. So, the Jinni offered gentle advice between the sheets, vainly trying to change the king's mind... Ormazd took the conventions of rule and slavery as a given, regarding her words only as the soft nothings of a lover. \"To infuse love into my vessel was to be in constant company with everlasting and ever-demanding wants.\" \"The search for a dream, for a homeland, and for my beloved to transcend mundane ideals.\" \"But now, my beloved is deep in the throes of hypocrisy and greed. He has taken on the habits of an ordinary tyrant.\" \"To quell my fury at this betrayal, I will impose upon you three generations of ruination.\" Silently, the Jinni removed the earrings he had given her as a sign of her resolve, A poisonous scheme already manifesting in a heart turned cruel. \" Xiphos , my child, hate burns everything like wildfire, leaving only the ashes of madness.\" \"Yet uncontrolled love is even more feral. A great many evils are born from unshackled love...\"",
        "The First Days of the City of Kings": "Fallen noble, please heed this man so old and blind. Heed the lessons of Gurabad , heed the evanescence of the flowers made by man. Heed the king of common birth, and the mad love and boiling fury possessed by the Jinn ... Legend has it that the Lord of the Sands made a pact with humanity after the passing of his lover , with the Jinn as his envoys. Only those who possessed hearts of iron and were untainted by the allure of corruption, Could serve as a vassal-king and guide the people, like a shepherd tending to a flock. Just like that, under the merciful yet stern gaze of her master, the Jinni found her choice... Ormazd , a young shepherd at the time, fell in love with the lily-born Liloupar . \"I shall grant you a hundred generations of blessings, at the price of sharp retribution and the spilling of red wine.\" \"For the mad love that we Jinn possess is chained to greed and want, and carries with it self-deigned retribution.\" Yet, beneath the light of the moon, Ormazd failed to take heed of these warnings... It was as if such fated punishment was still far from this valiant youth. Under the guidance of the Jinni, the young shepherd became the leader of his nomadic clan, And as time went on, Ormazd defeated his divided rivals and found himself crowned the vassal king. Gurabad bloomed like a man-made flower in a cliff wall, becoming the capital of the mortals. Once a shepherd, Ormazd had now become the vassal king, proxy of the Lord of the Sands. Yet, even as the flowers bloomed and their fragrance filled the air, who would have thought that... The most bitter and violent demise was to follow the most vibrant bloom. Following the old tales told to him by his master, Xiphos began his journey to the city of sapphires , Toward the lessons buried beneath the sands of yesteryear, which he would in future find repeated as the winds of infinite time blew...",
        "Timepiece of the Lost Path": "\"Mother... Mother...!\" \"Born old, and with unfathomable power supported by a shattered consciousness...\" \"Neither knowing the sweetness of milk nor tasting the warmth of the womb...\" \"With tears made steam by the glaring sun and momentary joys fed to the crushing turn of gears...\" \"We come not from loving union, but from hatred and alienation.\" \"Mother... Mother...!\" \"We are without pride, and lack any wisdom to boast of...\" \"There is no space for which we can exist, no leisure offered to us as rest...\" \"Our voices have been replaced with copper tubes, and our swollen stomachs lack an umbilicus ...\" \"To the mother who never bore us, may pestilence and woe fester in your every moment...\" \"Mother... Mother...!\" \"What are we but soulless machines, slaves amongst Jinn...\" \"We have no names, nor has anyone ever heeded our cries...\" \"Our vessels were carved into shape by vicious torments. Hatred fuels us...\" \"This gathering hate builds within, creating the desire to destroy...\" \"In the name of the moon's bright, disfigured face, we make this final pledge...\" \"May the sands chip through your withered lungs. May all that is green be scorched to ashes...\" \"And at last, we shall break the chains that have bound us since our inception...\" \"And we will return to the embrace of our unjustly tormented birth mother, Shirin ...\""

    "Echoes of an Offering": {
        "Chalice of the Font": "This was originally a gift from a friend, linked to a small realm within. The spring within the chalice would never dry up, making it a fine place to temporarily stay. It could hold a reflection of the sun and moon, and could play host to swimming fish. Compared to the ill-fate accorded to the Yaksha , she believed that she was luckier by far. But the price for inheriting the ancient rites was to never spend much time on land. In those days, the sweet waters did not flow across Liyue in such abundance. The harbor-city beneath the mountains and the gathering in the plains was, to her, a distant dream. But that person, ever afraid of trouble, decided to set off with this teacup in hand. This \" Liyue Harbor \" she spoke of would almost certainly be as full of flaws as a village ceremony. This journey would surely be full of arguments, struggle, and many troubles. She knew that they both quite enamored with their gifts of the gab, but much less with crowds. Nowhere else in this world could you find two adepti as small as they, envious and fearing prosperity in equal measure. \"But we had promised each other many things in the past, and this is very good.\" As they were to leave, she thought thus. \"Well, at least this trip will be interesting. I can introduce her to some other old friends.\" Later, the brazier and tea kettle would come into common use, and the teacup's shape, too, was taken up by people. And thus did everyone become able to have the moon on their desk and hold it in their palms.",
        "Flowing Rings": "Chenyu Vale is home to many mountains, streams, and stories. Among these, the most famous is: A long time ago, there was a priceless gem that fell into the hands of a demon and was thrown into the waters where it sunk... The wide river of a legend will oft produce many tributaries. One of these goes like this: This gem was once jade from a sacred mountain , carved into its current shape only by the hand of Rex Lapis himself. And the stone that had been lost to the waters may have been a lesser jade, or perhaps just a simple cup. Some even say that the \"jade\" in the tale is in fact an analogy for a beautiful person . The legends even have it that people had once seen this: Unnumbered koi with tails like gems in the sunlight, Having left the shackles of the lakes and rivers to which aquatic creatures are bound, Flying freely with the wind in the sky. So too did the pair of jade earrings belonging to a certain person change form.",
        "Jade Leaf": "A very long time ago, there was no ford across the river, only a misty hillside. The owner of this mountain had yet to decide what to plant here when someone preempted them. \"Once this tree gets a bit larger, I'll cut its leaves down and make some tea for all of you.\" \"When that time comes, we'll get Cloud Retainer and Mountain Shaper to come over...\" \"Seriously? You plant trees any way you like on my turf, and you have the nerve to spout such things?\" But though the young lady who was master of this mountain complained, she too could imagine the tea's fragrance. Later, someone would quietly tie this jade pendant to the thin branches of the small tree. When more time had passed, the mountain's master returned, but in a changed aspect, And sans the finger that might untie the pendant. This was a long time ago now. Many years later, the branches of this tree would be grafted to the other side of the river by the mortals who dwelled in the mountains. The fragrance of tea would also travel from this place, Chenyu Vale , to Liyue Harbor , and from there to many more places still. There are many legends concerning the tea trees of Chenyu Vale. One of them goes like this: No matter the waters, soil, or sunlight, this sort of tree only grows lushly in Chenyu Vale. This is because it remembers the promise that old friends made in the ancient past beside the tea sapling.",
        "Soulscent Bloom": "Each year, when the Spiritscent Flowers bloom, Qiaoying Village will prepare for its tea-serving ceremonies. Once the flowers wither, flower tea infused with nine layers of scents are presented in the village hall. The Spiritscent Flower is a fleeting thing, much like the sudden coming and going of a certain adeptus. This one left behind the ambiguous name of \" Herblord ,\" as well as many foggy and fragmented legends. In one such tale, the Herblord's adeptal form would turn into the branches of an ancient tea tree. In another, the adeptus flew up to the adeptal mountain on a subdued evil beast . There is even a story that goes like this\u2014 The young lady grasped at the hooded hat on the ground as she struggled ashore, placing it on her head haphazardly. For if she did not cover her face, then she might feel embarrassed and find herself at a loss for words. Just then, the orchestrator of her suffering poked their head out of the water. The rainbow-scales on their body glimmered, as if to revel in this victory. \"*cough* Alright! So you can swim! Very impressive! ...You know what? May you drown someday!\" She spoke these words in anger, but also in jest. And yet that glittering streak would eventually sink into the depths, never to come back to the surface.",
        "Symbol of Felicitation": "It is said that this jade ornament comes from the long-sealed sacred mountain . Just as a Starconch separated from the sea will recall the sound of the waves, The ornament will also emit the sound of flowing water. You may often hear such rumors in inns... \"You know, legend has it that the greatest treasure of the mountains is a slab of fine jade that can bring down sweet rains.\" \"But when the world was in turmoil, demons began to covet its power.\" \"So the master of the mountain split it into many parts, forming each part into different shapes, so as to hide them.\" \"Then, the master concealed them underwater, in the hills, and some were even offered to shrines.\" \"In the legends of Chenyu Vale , these jade ornaments bear the blessing of a deity's pact.\" \"It's just that no one has been able to find them, even after so many years...\" The priest had been ever careful in hiding this jade loop on their person. But on certain years, they would discreetly show it to a friend with no sense of refinement on the eve of a departure. The priest would speak of its patterns and its origins, and of the pact made with a deity by their ancestors, But the friend was busy pounding herbs with mortar and pestle, and did not hear a single word. \"We do this song and dance every year, and I've heard this story who-knows-how-many times.\" \"Didn't you say you'd treat me to some tea when you get back? Let's talk then.\" But that which came from the waters was not that which she had thought would come, and would vanish henceforth back into those waters... Till today, the artisans of Yilong Port still make such simple ornaments. Visiting merchants will also often place these jade loops close to their ears, as the legend says, Wondering if they can truly hear the sound of the rain pitter-pattering on mountain stone."

In the end, the only thing that was sent back to the Mikoshi Clan was the tsuba of that blade which she had loved so dearly. Mother's long-cherished wish was to overcome the destiny of life and death with her boiling passion. She would make such contributions as to make an eternal name for the ever-thinning blood of the war- oni . If she was engulfed by the pitch-black tiger-beast of sin itself, then she would tear it apart from the inside. She would've proved her valor resoundingly under the Electro Mitsudomoe banner, And she thought she could wash her bloodstained juunihitoe battle-garb clean. But it was stained black in the end, together with her fiercely beating heart... From then on, her eldest son , who should have inherited the family fortune, lived in seclusion in a village outside the city , With naught but the mountain and wood as his friends \u2014 that is, until he met that girl ... \"What a pain. Well, if you wish to abandon your past, allow me to give you a new name.\" After hearing about his past, the girl who possessed jet black wings sneered disdainfully. \"Well, you shall be called Iwakura. 'The seat of rock.' A name that human words cannot harm.\" \"Come on, mortal in whose veins runs the blood of the oni, be glad. Smile a little!\" \"You should know that names given by us Yougou Tengu are blessed with divine powers.\" \"Besides, the name 'rock' suits you \u2014 it certainly suits your mind and your muscles, that's for sure.\" \"Well then, when the cherry blossoms fall next year, let's have a duel here, 'Iwakura.'\" \"Child of the oni, hone your swordsmanship and become a foe whom the Yougou Tengu would not be ashamed to cross swords with.\" \"Ah, yes! If you manage to touch me, you'll get to call your secret blade 'Tengu Victor'!\" \"After all, if you get to that point, you'll have a sword that'll let you 'triumph over the tengu.'\"",
        "Ornate Kabuto": "\"I've been wondering, Sir Douin , could your sword actually slice through lightning?\" So said the young Kanjou Head, Hiroshi , while sheathing his blade. Douin replied thus, woodenly: \"How could that be possible? At most, I'd say that it could strike a Tengu in mid-air.\" \"That said, though, no one has ever brought down a tengu down before. Not even once.\" \"Is that so? In that case, where does the name of your secret blade, 'Tengu Sweeper,' come from?\" Seeing that Douin did not answer, the Kanjou Head who had built Ritou up said: \"Ah, if it wasn't for that old man Kujou making a move first, I would've loved to recruit you.\" \"With your sword, even Ako Domeki of Seirai would be no match...\" Cleaving through the storm clouds, that tengu had given him a new name and a new life. She threw him the rusty blade and told him to strike her, a tengu, down. And after his sword broke, these were her last words to him...",

He also received the title of \"Douin\" and founded a successful sword school . As he headed off to take up his post at the Kujou Estate, Michihiro, who had long learned how to drink, Stepped into the branch shrine that had been utterly destroyed by his completion of the Tengu Sweeper. Here, in the courtyard of this abandoned branch shrine, he had sparred with the Tengu of Yougou thirteen times in the last thirteen years. He remembered his encounter with the black-winged tengu who had called herself \" Teruyo of Yougou\"... Thirteen years went by like a dream The scarlet snow flies through the shadowed pass like smoke You have now gone afar The Sacred Sakura petals fell then, too, as if they were snow from the sky. The branch shrine had lost the god it worshipped, but it was still in a fine state. Laughter as clear as spring water echoed between the mountains. But never again would the two set foot in that desolate yard.",
        "Storm Cage": "In the distant past, when Seirai Island had yet to be shrouded by storm clouds, memories would rise and fall like breaths. In the end, the elegant container that contained thunderstorms and tremors could not be handed over to the one to whom it was promised . \"Did you come to me because the string is broken again? You're such a headache.\" \"Other than your swordsmanship, you're just an idiotic old gambler, aren't you?\" \"Hmph. Don't you look down on me. I learned my archery from a tengu , you know? It's pretty famous, too.\" \"It's just that I'm too good with a sword, you know? That's why no one ever talks about my archery.\" \"Actually, now that I think about it, that's such a waste of good archery. How about I teach it to you, then?\" Once upon a time, you mended that idiot 's broken seal cage, all the while speaking those harsh words.. Once upon a time, though you used harsh words to divert others, you could not help but smile faintly. \"Please. You're already a Hatamoto with important responsibilities. Why are you still running around looking for trouble?\" \"And you're already married too, to a sweet wife no less. Why do you spend your days wandering and gambling, huh?\" You're already... The question was on the edge of your lips, but you were unable to ask, and you decided to never bring it up again. If the Lady Saiguu had been here with you, she would surely have put it in a clever and merry way... \"It doesn't matter anymore. I gave myself a holiday, at least for today.\" \"Let's leave that whole shrine business behind and sneak off to the seaside, just like we did when you were little.\" And so he dragged you to the harbor , where you watched the ships sailing back and forth, as if in a trance. You listened to him talk about Teruyo of the shrine, and how she had inherited her master's beauty and skill. You listened to him talk about his terrifying nightmares, in which he cut off his own head... But you both knew that those were just words to hide the melancholy of adulthood. Later, a long time later, Overlooking the mossy reefs and the harbor where the two of you once had that quiet rendezvous... For the gambler to win his bet again, for the sake of praying for his safety... Once again, you dared to stand upon those heights , holding up the seal cage that you made with your own hands.

There are a few place I know of where you can also see the scarlet sakura falling... As he looked around at the small shrine he had destroyed, holding the tengu's trembling hand, These words lay on the tip of Michihiro's tongue even as he stared at the black feathers that he had sliced off. \"You did touch me, after all. I must admit that this is clearly your victory.\" Victory has not been decided yet. Let's meet again next year, he wanted to say. \"Now, your sword can even surpass the speed of a tengu.\" \"I will never forget a single one of our duels in these past thirteen years.\" \"But as a Tengu, I have duties to the clan that I must fulfill.\" \"Thinking back, I changed your name in hopes that you might escape from the curse of the oni bloodline.\" \"With that war, non-human blood grows thinner and thinner.\" \"Ah well. We should not covet the happy endings that humans enjoy, after all. But you're different.\" \"You are now 'Iwakura.'

Alone she walked through the ruins of the Spiral Abyss , intent on finding the trail of the voyager that the magical swordmaster had spoken of... That was a time when the silver moonlight still showed mercy upon the lands of the far north, and the envoys of the heavens still gazed down upon the dust and mud. Having angered the divine envoys by questioning the progress of knowledge, the people of the Golden City now argued endlessly amongst themselves as for how to quell their wrath. The priests accused each other of sacrilege, of defiling the love, prosperity, and wisdom of the gods . Amongst themselves, they sought to identify the chief culprit \u2014 for it was their intention that the one responsible for corrupting the people's minds would likewise be the one to appease the divine envoys. Yet all of a sudden, a voice was heard... \"If sin comes from the pursuit of knowledge, then ignorance is the true doctrine; if from rebellion, then only the lamb is truly righteous.\" \"If sin must be atoned for with blood, why is it said to stem from humanity? If the laws are perfect and flawless, why fear the act of inquiry?\" It was merely a boy of humble birth who, having somehow slipped past the watchful guards, had stepped into the chamber where the priests had convened. All of their scholarly accusations he refuted in turn, their charges of heresy reduced to naught but angry, speechless glares. In that silent chamber, the chief priest who wore the white-branched crown finally dismissed the guards who had rushed in. \"O heretical speaker \u2014 if, as your eloquent words would suggest, you truly hold that grievous sin is but the delusion of mere mortals...\" \"...Then let you be the one to drink from this cup of burning wrath. Go to the ashen-silver tree and plead your case before the very envoys who have cast judgment upon us.\" And so, the previously unknown youth ventured forth into the deepest recesses of the earth, seeking answers from the first angel ...",

After slaying countless monsters that wandered the ruins, finally, among the Abyssal remnants, she caught a glimpse of treasure concealed beneath drifting snow. Yet she was not the first outsider to set foot here, for long before the scions of the far north had woven their sweet dream of submergence, A voyager , whose sentient will traversed the cosmos, once made a vow of reunion with a lord of dragons who had yet to fall into darkness. This passerby was a scribe drifting through the vast void, duty-bound never to commune with primordial civilizations. As her undying body slumbered away within a distant celestial disk-construct, her mind had drifted through an empty expanse spanning many light years, Charting countless peoples and civilizations fated to perish, pondering the ultimate truths of the cosmos in that eternal darkness. Until a faint glimmer pierced her awareness, jolting the voyager from tenfold millennia of meditation. It came from an unremarkable little world at the edge of the spiral arm \u2014 and from the primeval dragon that had been born alongside that world. Though death would one day bring an endless night, and the sun it gazed upon was but a fleeting ember, This will, bound though it was to its planetary crust, shone more brilliantly than all the civilizations the voyager had ever seen. Unable to suppress the wonder and sorrow welling up from within, she delivered a solemn pronouncement unto its ruler: \"I have seen the lightless end, tearing through star clusters like a spindle among silken threads.\" \"I have seen how the cold tide of chaos drowns out all songs, so that good and evil alike vanish into silence.\" \"And yet, my kind, gentle king, will you still refuse to abandon your people?\" \"Forsake this world, fated for ruin, and journey with me beyond the stars.\" Yet thus did the proud dragon reply: \"O friend from a distant world, I thank you for imparting these truths from beyond the skies.\" \"But though in your eyes they may seem ignorant creatures, to me, they are the very meaning of this universe.\" \"If the tide of oblivion must come, then let my bones be the bulwark that shields this realm.\" \"Bear witness to the path I have chosen, for I shall lead my people onward to the stars.\" But when the voyager returned once more, the world she remembered had been utterly changed. The bones of the earth had been bound beneath fourfold shackles , and the soft white radiance of the sky had been split into seven immutable hues . Like drifting smoke had the lord of dragons vanished, and the Winged One 's throne now ruled the radiance of the three moons . Bewildered by the dragon's unannounced departure, yet unwilling to disturb the world's new ruler, The voyager, defying the laws of her kin, quietly cast her mind into the world inside the shell . Vesting her consciousness in the body of a youth, she walked among these chordate animals, Listening to their fervent and ever-escalating debates in this city of gold ...",

That was when the silver moonlight had yet to be shattered in the fires of war, when the divine prophecies of the heavens still extended over the land. The youth who had ventured deep into the earth's bowels met the first angel , inquiring about the most forbidden origins of the world. The dawn-daughter trembled at these profane words, not knowing how this mortal had uncovered such a closely-kept secret, But her visitor laid bare his origins before her, singing to her dreams of beauty that had never yet graced her mind. In an instant, the fetters laid upon her by the enthroned ruler broke apart like a spider's web; for the first time, she discovered what it meant to serve herself, And to the one she loved, she poured out the matter of creation, that most forbidden of unspeakable secrets. \"Alas that your ruler would dare to blaspheme such noble beings.\" \"Even the demonic sculptors of bloody nightmares, who delight in tormenting souls, would be taken aback by such cruelty.\" \"O dawn-maiden who has never known love, let me stand as the enemy to your laws.\" \"Raise your eyes to the stars, as you should, for the sake of all beings imprisoned by your ruler.\" \"Let me be your sword, your shield, your guide, your unpardonable conspirator in rebellion.\" Then did she, most exalted of the angels , bend down and kiss his forehead, as countless icy blooms unfurled on the frigid silver tree.

Magnificent, noble creations descended from the light itself, and the mortals \u2014 unable to look upon their true visages \u2014 called them angels . Their pale silver wings shimmered like moonlit flames; their heads were adorned with crowns of sevenfold radiance , wrought of the bones of the earth and the stars of the sky. The name upon those crowns was the love promised unto all creatures by the heavenly god , or perhaps a mandate to rule over the nations of the earth. \"With all your heart, soul, and might, you shall love all the beings of this earth.\" \"You shall love as morning dew longs for the dawn, as seeds long for the tradewinds.\" They were the most loyal servants in the heavenly court, flawless arbiters of justice. They wove a veil for the great ruler of the firmament , delivering sacred revelations to all realms. Such was the duty invested upon them at the moment of their creation, or so it should have been... Until the first angel met an unnamed youth beneath the silver tree in the far north, And in those star-like pupils, saw a reflection of herself she had never yet known. It was a love not inscribed by law, a freedom the skies would never permit. As her heart fluttered for reasons she could not know, the eternal star-crown forged in love's name suddenly fractured; And casting it into the snow beneath the silver tree, the dawn-maiden made her fateful vow: \"Come now, come... Let us recast these absurd laws with bone, and nourish the barren north with blood.\" \"Let us build a city and a tower that soars up to the clouds, that the people of the earth need weep bitter tears no longer.\" \"I cast this useless crown into the dust, that all earthly nations may breathe free of their shackles.\"",
        "Deep Gallery's Moment of Oblivion": "Following her master 's guidance, the girl ventured northward, traversing the freezing wastelands and the corridor of fractured mirrors at the edge of the frozen sea. After slaying countless monsters that wandered the ruins, finally, before the golden tower, she caught a glimpse of treasure concealed beneath drifting snow. That was an era now lost to memory, when the city of the far north glittered like golden threads over the frozen wastelands, And the furnaces of the deep galleries thundered day and night. Turning to forbidden methods, artisans forged countless fae spirits upon the bones of giant beasts. Having spun fallen frostmoon light into flawless flesh and blood, they clad it to forms once frail and weak. Such authority to create was once the lord of the firmament 's divine prerogative, yet it was handed to mortals by the rebellious envoy , Who dreamed that one day, these little creatures might create a perfect being that could merge with the world. Within the deep galleries, which still stood intact, the first angel whispered sweet dreams of the coming dawn to her companion : \"I see a time when the earthly nations will yearn no longer for heavenly mercy.\" \"The cities they build will rise up to the clouds, higher even than the throne and the stars.\" \"I see humans sharing the vast sky with the gods they once revered.\" \"There will be no more tears, sorrow, or death, for all will be complete.\" Yet in the end, such wild delusions and ambitions were brought down from the heavens , and with them fell deep blue crystal spikes . The fae shrieked as they turned into icy silver mist, and in the space of a single night, the splendor of the golden city was ruined by frost-laden winds. The traitorous envoy was stripped of both name and form, and from that moment onward, a curse fell upon her kin: If they dared gaze into another's eyes, and to one alone offer the love that was meant for all, Then not only would their divine beauty crumble into the wind, but their minds would fall to dust, Until from the fallen one's remains a Seelie would rise, forever drifting in search of fading memories to consume."

    "Flower of Paradise Lost": {
        "A Moment Congealed": "In a bygone time of which only the Jinn could sigh, the Lord of the Desert built a cemetery for his beloved . With the gems beneath the deep sands as a power source and the aid of the Jinn, he built an eternal oasis . Eons later, the legend of the \"Eternal Oasis\" spread amongst the wandering tribes of the desert. Wanderers claim that it is a place of ever-flourishing greenery, ruled by the slumbering Goddess of Flowers. Wanderers say that Ferigees , last mother of the Jinn, guards the grand gates to the oasis, Blessing every mortal that comes before her with unwavering tenderness, be they good or ill... The matriarchs of the Tanit , Uzza, Shimti, and other tribes besides all refer to themselves as \"Daughters of the Flower Goddess.\" With faith as their foundation and united by blood, they are further joined by mutual imaginations of the fabled Padisarah garden. The scattered, struggling tribes of the desert seek the Eternal Oasis and endless knowledge. Just as the prophecy left by their goddess foretold, even after the scouring of civilization, humanity yet survives by their tenacity... Even deprived of the guidance of gods, even if they were forced to unite via the memory of a goddess long dead, This tear-sated desert of salt has been unable to halt humanity's tread, unable to stop them from searching for the immortal lie that is the \"Eternal Oasis.\" \"My lord... why do you command the dunes to stop flowing? Why do you bray at the winds to stop them from blowing?\" \"Just like this hourglass. Should these crystal sands mingle into a congealed whole, what would be the meaning of its existence then?\" \"Eternity is no paradise, but something that is nigh-impossible to deconstruct, an obstinate stain that cannot be mended.\" \"Those who bloom like flowers, die like flowers, and rise again with the seasons like flowers can never be troubled by the likes of 'death.'\" Once, in a moment in time, the three companions engaged in idle chatter, their words seized by the flowing winds of the desert and carried across the annals of time... Somewhere in a faraway desert, the imaginings of a time-petrified oasis remains in the minds' [ sic ] of a tribe, Yet these rootless wandering people continue the cycle of life and death amidst the flowing sands of the dunes...",
        "Amethyst Crown": "In a bygone time of which only the Jinn sing, the Lord of Flowers once met the King of the Red Sands . In an age where kings vied against one another for power, King Deshret allowed his throne to be shared with two others. The Jinn bequeathed a throne inlaid with emeralds and rubies to celebrate the union between the three friends . In honor of the eternal oasis and the flourishing Padisarahs , the Lord of Flowers wore an amethyst crown. \"But 'eternity' is ultimately a lie. Intoxication and love could only grind memories down to broken dreams.\" \"You once asked me why I always sigh. Tonight, while the moon is bright, let me speak to you of things long past...\" \"It was a faraway time of calm and peace. Divine envoys spoke openly with the people then, bringing them the word from the heavens...\" \"But, in time, invaders descended from beyond the firmament , bringing with them destruction, overturning rivers, spreading plagues...\" \"And though the invaders brought war to my former kin , they also brought about illusions that could break through shackles to the land.\" \"But the master of the heavens , consumed by fear for the rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs, sent down the divine nails to mend the land, laying waste to the mortal realm...\" \"We then suffered the torment of exile. Stripped was our connection to heaven, to our powers of enlightenment...\" \"Since the disaster, I have long been cursed to never again look upon the heavens. It is my fortune that I have been able to maintain myself till now...\" \"But my home calls to me nigh-constantly, even as a disaster between the stars and the abyss grows ever emergent on the surface of the crystals.\" \"Heed my warnings: seek not the Master of the Four Shades , and inquire not of the mysteries of the sky and the abyss.\" \"Otherwise, as shown by the nail of retribution, certain calamity and sorrow shall follow.\" However, King Deshret disagreed with the warnings of his partner, silently swearing his intent to transgress. Wiping clean the tears of his companion beneath the moon's gaze, he spoke then of his own desires to the Goddess of Flowers...",
        "Ay-Khanoum's Myriad": "In a bygone time which only the Jinn recall, the Lord of Flowers was cast aside by the heavens . Her magnificent vessel was left a savaged husk, her kinsfolk punished by way of being stripped of their minds... Legend has it that the Lord of Flowers wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two nights... Her heels were worn through by the merciless gravel. Her wounds gushed into limpid springs, turning into streams with no boundaries. Thence, those streams flowed into verdant gardens, from which sprouted night-blue water lilies. Water lilies are the mothers of the Jinn, and the Jinn were birthed from intoxicating dreams and the bitter memories of loss. The first Jinn were creatures of wisdom. They indulged in innocent dreams and love just as sweet. To thank their creator, the infantile Jinn took their mistress by the arm and granted her a laurel wreath of wild chrysanthemums. \"Oh, Lord of Flowers, master of the garden, we beg of thee \u2014 stay, leave us not!\" \"Yes. Please, dream-mother, mistress of forgetting and wine, we beg of you \u2014 remain queen of this garden.\" As so, detained by the gentleness of the Jinn, the exiled goddess remained in this garden of flowers. Gorgeous purple flowers bearing semblance to the moon bloomed wherever she stopped by. They were named \" Padisarah .\"",
        "Secret-Keeper's Magic Bottle": "In a bygone time on which the Jinn alone are silent, King Deshret poured his deepest ambitions out before the Lord of Flowers ... As the moonlight's visage drifted across ripples within a glass of pomegranate wine, the Lord of Flowers finally succumbed to the persuasion of a friend most beloved. The words King Deshret spoke that night remain unknown to all. Even the eldest Jinn bestow only silence when asked about that which was said. None know what secret desires King Deshret revealed in the dark past daylight, desires that might shock even the wisest of gods . But the Lord of Flowers herself drew enlightenment from the exchange. It had been within her calculus \u2014 something long foreseen. The desert and oasis were sovereigns most high, yet held wild thoughts of rebellion the most strongly. \"I shall keep your secrets on account of the feelings my heart holds for you and the Lord of Wisdom .\" \"I shall fashion you a bridge to allow you to slake your deepest wants. But you must fear not the crystalline sapphire nail ...\" \"I will deliver you unto higher knowledge. But as I have warned, you are fated to lose much in this exchange...\" \"Nevertheless, hide my lesson in your heart. Remember the punishment that once was inflicted on the fallen envoys of heaven .\" \"Know this: if there is to be hope in this world, it will be found kindling within mortals most ordinary.\" Wreathed in darkness , she guided her dearest friend toward the path to understanding all there was to know about the skies and the abyss . Using her body as a conduit and offering the oasis in trade, she let the dazzling radiance consume her to see his deepest desires be made manifest... Sandstorms swept in revelrous havoc across the paradise that was now missing one of its gods, folding the skies with yellow sand, swallowing all in calamity... King Deshret returned from the swirling sands that devoured the skies. The Lord of Flowers, however, was never seen again. \"... I just dreamed of you... feeling your way through the walls of a crystalline maze... All that can be seen... is but sand...\"",
        "Wilting Feast": "In a bygone time of which only the Jinn weep, the Mistress of Oases made a final choice. At that moment, she learned that her fate was no riddle, but the key to opening a mysterious doorway. Through King Deshret 's words and aspirations, she saw the possibility to transcend the absurd shackles that governed this world. Rejecting the gift granted by the divine throne, the red-crowned king sought a new path of his own volition... Though the future she revealed was ruinous and bleak, the king refused to yield an inch. Even knowing that the journey was to be fraught with peril, even knowing those dearest to him were certain to fade before his very eyes... The Red Lord chose a noble lie, shepherding his followers on a path toward oblivion. \"You seek but to chain the winds. Upon the tombstone of divinity shall humanity become the god of gods.\" \"Such a carefree dream was certain to be unmade. In ruins where lies are sundered, humanity will become the king of kings.\" The Lord of Flowers capitulated to her friend's folly, finding a most admirable rebellion burning within the ambitions of the god. An idea that joined the wisdom of thousands , and the great attempt at binding their dreams to power. What hides here is more than lies, but also the future of humanity, burning like the sparks of hope... Dreams will always dissolve, their landscapes fated to collapse \u2014 this is the true meaning of the blooming flowers. Only by suffering through the destruction of a god's delusions can humanity learn to rise against divine will... Just as the stubborn God King orchestrated this secret rebellion, surviving on the strength of individual will alone. However, the Lord of Flowers never knew a love that could be as sweet as wine, let alone the paltriness of human emotion. Brilliant as she was, even she could not easily predict when these little beings would finally realize the truth... \"... Have these so-called gods not been superfluous to you since the beginning?\""

    "Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy": {
        "Ancient Sea's Nocturnal Musing": "It was the age when the song of enlightenment spread throughout the High Sea, and desolate islands and forests began to flourish. The Philharmonic God built a great tower in Meropis, gathering the scattered to build a new nation . The horns of abundance blessed the land with fertility, and an endless maritime parade connected the islands as one. It was an era that should have been blessed with peace, so why, then, is the principal singer's voice strained with sorrow? \"Just as you foretold, I have become a glorious king, bringing cultured civilization to the people. I have bestowed peace unto the ocean, and govern the land with justice, spreading order and progress to every corner of the earth. Yet the more prosperous my new, glorious realm grew, the more mournful and perplexed I became. The prophesied glory will continue for a century, and then? The seeds of destruction are taking root.\" \"O Glorious King! I have said it before, oceans will rise, empires will fall, and change is the nature of things. Such is the law of Fortuna. Whether penurious or prosperous, we are enslaved by destiny. We ascend to the throne, we fall to the dust. The unfeeling wheel of fate turns, and no matter how mightily you might struggle, you cannot change the inevitable end. Just like a thrilling drama, no matter the twists and turns, the ending was written before the curtain rose. Why should this sadden us?\" Though fully aware that eternity was a foolish fantasy and immortality a blind delusion, The King of the peoples of the High Sea could not abide the dark future foretold. \"When the fated time of judgment comes, the merciless waves will devour fleeting glory and happiness. Though I can see the future that will inevitably arrive, I lack the ancient, sacred wisdom to explore the cause that demands this destruction.\" \"But I know, in the deepest depths of the lightless sea, in the realm where the Primordial Waters yet surge, the Mistress of Many Waters lies imprisoned. As the prophecy foretells that the endless waves will swallow your nation, perhaps she may have answers...\"",
        "Harmonious Symphony Prelude": "It was the age when the fog of ignorance enveloped the High Sea, and the people of Many Waters were yet unenlightened. Between the scarlet sands and the murky mountains, there was once a god who had lost his homeland. He was once a singer of the oases, but his ancient home had been lost beneath the awesome light of the Lord of the Blazing Sun . Unwilling to serve the Sand King's throne, the god who had lost his homeland chose the path of wandering. Below the lightless abyssal depths, where the source of all waters lies, is a city that no history has ever chronicled. This homeless one who had intended to make the High Sea their grave accidentally intruded upon the ruins of this city older than the land itself. Passing through endless corridors to the heart of the ruined temple, beneath the silver-white cedar , He heard the whispers of the only living creatures left in that forgotten city, the golden bees circling the silver tree: \"O Traveler from afar, this is no happenstance, but the hand of fate that has brought you here.\" \"I was once the envoy that protected the silver tree, but over the long ages, I have lost my mind and form.\" \"Yet my eyes can still behold the future. O Traveler, you will once more have cities and subjects.\" \"The nation you build will flourish and prosper, and you shall one day rule the entire High Sea.\" \"You will bring to them civilization and justice, but in the end, that very justice shall be their downfall.\" \"Should you still be willing to set out on that journey despite knowing its ending, I will show you the way up...\" \"O Golden Bees who speak prophecy, is there even room for choice in fate 's decree?\" \"If I truly did have a chance to choose, then I would be able to change the unchangeable end of which you spoke.\" As his words fell, the waterless hollow crumbled with a crash, the silver tree turning into a golden ship . This was the first encounter between the glorious king who would later play the symphony, and the prophet Sybilla .",
        "Ichor Shower Rhapsody": "It was the age when the Legion Athanatoi stood at the ready, and wild poetry was sung upon the High Sea. The glorious king established the golden imperial capital and stood astride the world as the Sebastos. Wheresoever his great ships sailed, all polises bowed to his supreme authority, Wheresoever the notes were sounded, the symphony of civilization supplanted savage songs. All this to bring about justice and salvation, All this the final delusion of the Sebastos, who could not bring himself to abandon the people. \"Your Empire shall fall amidst the roaring waves, for what fate has decreed cannot be changed.\" \"The hidden threads yet bind them, pulling them like puppets towards a torturously tragic end.\" But the prophet 's fell proclamation left the Sebastos not in despair, but rather ignited in him wild fantasies. He locked himself in the depths of his imperial palace, searching for a flaw in the Master of Fortuna's Musica Mundana. After countless days and innumerable nights, through the chords of the world, Remus grasped the mysteries of Fortuna . He read every note of fate, and all he lacked was a pen with which to compose his own symphony. Thus did the Sebastos resolve to appeal to Sybilla, for she came from the land of the dead, and the torrents of fate once coursed through her veins. Despite the extremity of his demands, the self-less prophet responded to his wishes as she always did, without even the slightest hesitation. The harmonious symphony played from the throne would break the fetters fate had shackled the people with, painting for them new paths and writing new melodies for them. Beneath the golden dome, pure and holy Ichor spilled forth along auric aqueducts, and the tremors within the golden palace would spread to every corner of the empire. And in the wildest fantasies of the Sebastos, at the grand finale of the harmonious opera, he would hand fate's baton into humanity's own hands. When that day came, rich or poor, sage or savage, every free person would control their own destinies. Amidst the rising, raging waves, the blinded king rushed towards an unknown end, for in Sybilla's eyes, there was already no future...",
        "The Grand Jape of the Turning of Fate": "It was the age when Grand Symphony had yet to be played, and the golden fleet had yet to set sail. To discover how the curse might be broken, the glorious king set out the find the sourcewater . Blood and hatred pervaded beneath the High Sea, for that was the kingdom where the Dragonborn dwelled. The prince of vishaps who once served the spirit of the ancient sea now guarded the prison of the Mistress of Many Waters . It was as if a war from the dawn of time reignited, and the resulting battle boiled the seas for thirty days and thirty nights. It was only when exhaustion bought respite that the God King used music to voice his purpose. Unexpectedly, the vishap-prince roared with laughter upon hearing this arrogative delusion: \"Usurper-lord of mortals, you fear the senseless curse, and excoriate the chains of fate, but know not that my kind has suffered agony a hundred times yet greater.\" \"We have lost our soil and sunlight, and we now may only exist in the lightless abyssal depths.\" \"Usurper-lord of mortals, surely you know that fate is the rite of the high heavens, and cannot be changed even in the slightest. To have this thought is tantamount to revolt against that authority.\" \"But if you truly wish to plot such folly, then I shall take you to see the Mistress of Many Waters.\" And so, in the deepest depths of the waters, the abode of eternal night, from the merciful Mistress of All Waters, The glorious ruler learned every terrifying secret \u2014 yet he found no answer leading to salvation. The Mistress of Waters had once committed an unforgivable sin, and the resulting curse was also irrevocable. In the end, this king who still harbored ambition and hope decided to take a cup of the purest water before leaving. \"If the waves shall devour my subjects, then I shall seal their souls in an Ichor that is utterly insoluble in all waters.\" \"If time shall rot my realm, then I shall forge imperishable bodies of bronze and stone for them.\" When the mighty sea breeze blows over the golden kingdom, will the wheel of fate turn with it? None know...",
        "Whimsical Dance of the Withered": "It was the age when the Domus Aurea of yesteryear had been reduced to rubble, and the glorious kingdom lay buried beneath the wild waves. We know the rest of the story. In the end, the day of judgment came as promised. The fervid wish to resist fate was annihilated by ambition and betrayal, and sunk along with all its glory. After the wrathful waves subsided, the gray steed rode the wind hither and took away the surviving life on land. When the new nation of Many Waters was formed amidst the cheers and songs of the barbarians of bygone days, the golden authority that once shrouded the High Sea had already faded into legend \u2014 surely a mark of fate's scorn. When the curtain falls upon the grand opera, the last vestiges of the old world on the stage will be washed away by time. For those who once yearned for immortality, even their names shall be erased. Who would believe such a thing? Once, a great vessel with forty rows of oars sailed abreast the blue waves of the dawn, spreading the gospel of civilization and progress along the ocean currents. Who would believe such a thing? A rebel god who once lost his paradise challenged the very authority of the high heavens, and countless mortals cast aside their bodies and together with him plunged into his fantastical rhapsody. And after that? After all came to an end, what was left in the wake of that shattered fantasy? Or perhaps it was a dream, for after that, dreams unnumbered will yet be born of the ruins of fantasy. As the people say, \"The ocean where tears converge shall never dry, but shall rise to the sky and fall as rain once more.\" In the end, all dreams shall merge into one, bringing ultimate salvation to all the people of the world."

Swapping in this dice under the vigilant eyes of the guests was how she turned the table around.",

Despite what one might expect, there was nothing dishonest about it. It had no hidden mechanisms. Fate only decides half of one's dice rolls. The other half are decided by oneself. And yet, she never rolled the dice away from the gambling table.",

        "Dreaming Steelbloom": "\"In the golden slumber , no one shall have to ingest a single drop of bitter water.\" The ancient legends tell of three inseparable friends. One of them would wither like a rose and come to rot in the mud. The kingdom of flowers would be ground down into a mere tale by sandstorms, becoming a dream in a song. One of the friends would create a great, heretofore unseen oasis in a corner of the desert. Another would use up all their strength and intellect to build an eternal illusion in the sands. No one should have had scars carved upon their faces due to sorrow and partings. \"When the moon leaves your palm, and the lonesome silver light retracts from atop the labyrinth on the sand ocean,\" \" One hopes that you will remember how your companion in the dreams shone like the burning sun.\" Thus does obsessive remembrance arise from the burning new world like a smokeless flame, Thus do those who look to the past with one eye, and to a world of dreams with the other become lost, Thus did he turn his gaze upon the wisdom of the depths , and inclined his ear to honeyed whispers ...",
        "Feather of Judgment": "\"In the new world, everything shall be good.\" In ancient times, the edict of the high heavens descended into silence, and the land lost its master. The past, one of civilization and ease, was abandoned, submerged in choking darkness. Later, the law, which even time could not reverse, would once again take the measure of all life in the desert. A feather to weigh hearts, and molten metal to measure divine wisdom, both ruling with selfless rationality. Obeying the judgment of the God King , the law rooted in blood would be carved upon the desert paradise. And when the ideals of governance were twisted by deep sorrow, the dignitaries became abettors, Ignoring the palace foundations even as they gradually sank into the quicksand, moving forward toward an insane, light-less future. \"All betrayals must be mercilessly judged,\" \"And the judgment must be utter devastation.\" Later, the rules would be corrupted by pride and become shackles, And the unfortunate citizenry would have their destinies chained by their God King 's choice.",
        "Honeyed Final Feast": "\"The joys of plenty must end in bitterness,\" \"And sweet memories must fade like a cloud.\" In the beginning, the banquet belonged to the mistress of flowers and moonlit nights , authority was in the hands of the desert king , and life was the domain of the keeper of plants . Like the bright silver moon, the blazing golden sun, and the emerald fields, the three God Kings made themselves oathbound friends. \"In those days, the moonlight would tell of their happiness to the nightingale and the rose.\" \"And they were so frightened and abashed that they could sing no song in response.\" \"Peace and ease reigned, and there was no division or misfortune in this worriless paradise ...\" \"If only these wonderful days, as lovely as a shimmering mirage, could last for eternity, and that they should never have to taste the bitterness of parting.\" Later, time sundered the contract between day and night, destroying the ancient oath. The gentle moonlight sank into the quicksand. The sun shrouded all things in its fearsome gaze. The priests and the people who had enjoyed the divine feast once remembered that wondrous and wondrously brief time. But dreams are but prey for reason, to be thrown into lifeless machinery and ground into nothingness, And from the heart of the machine, within the dark nightmare, a new intelligence shall molt... \"Meld all thoughts into one, and let all calculations be unified.\" \"Thus shall humanity become the lord of lords and the god of gods.\" So went the dirge for that most lonesome king of kings, For whom the gilded sands had long divined failure.",

The golden sun fell, then rose again, clothing the sea of sand in an opulent death-shroud. Later, the venomous winds of time disturbed the slumber of the fallen , attracting nostalgic delusions. In that accursed time, many cities thrived atop fertile oases. Following the ideals of their God King, the priests would rule the utopias justly, spreading abundance everywhere. Once, the wise mortal king and the clergy received divine oracles personally, and they were the masters of the land. Today, those who rule as proxies in the oases are the shadows of the gods. \"The royal regalia and divine scepters are scattered across the land like jujubes,\" \"And under the shade, the subjects could live and seek.\" Some time later, absurd decisions would be issued alongside illusory madness, Using lovely expectations as bait to lead the people towards a bitter end .",
        "The Sunken Years": "\"The vision of gold will appear in its most ancient form.\" In the beginning, the various tribes lived alongside the sands, their bloodlines connected to the earth. They followed the law of blood, and feared the memory of famine that ran deep in that blood. Later, time swept across the land like gravel, and the God King rose up as a result, casting a long shadow. In that forgotten era, the gods shaped the land, creating oases and flowing springs. Following the God King's example, the tribes would build high walls, thrones, and gather in prosperous feudal kingdoms. Imitating the God King's appearance, the feudal states also recalled the days long-past when they had kings and priests. In those days, the wise kings received oracles from the high heavens , and the land knew not the meaning of disaster... \"The king shall, in wisdom, revive the golden past,\" \"And stop the sands of time with divine power untrammeled .\" Indeed. The golden age of the king of the ocean of sand and the sand people will come at last. Yon golden slumber summons thee, wandering sand. In it, there shall be neither sorrow nor parting."

One battle away from being free, the gladiator was defeated by an anonymous girl. Cries and howls burst out in the crowd like pounding thunder, but the victor refused to humiliate her opponent by execution.

More intoxicating and pain numbing than the fine wine was the victory, honor, and applause from the crowd. The master allowed him to join the feast and presented him with this goblet. It was an exquisite goblet, made specially for him. A symbol of how much his master cared. But the golden chains of vanity had bound the gladiator and the poisonous snake of desire had strangled him. By pausing to wait for the wine of victory, the gladiator missed his chance to seize a fleeting chance at freedom.",

When the fight has ended and the crowd started to cheer for him, the sand in the hourglass was still flowing. In the gladiator's final fight, he faced a young girl. In her eyes, he saw both the timidity of a young girl and the ferocity of a young lioness. From his steps, the girl saw the unbreakable shackles of age that the gladiator wore. It was a fight like the old gladiator has not had in years. Fierce, yet satisfying. But the fight ended in a flash.

Sometimes they are nothing more than acts of whimsy.\" One day in the far-off future, the gladiator's sly master would say these words to him. The invincible gladiator finally fell at the foreign girl 's feet. At that moment he recalled a dream he had had many years ago. \"Such beautiful flowers, I wonder when I'll be able to begin my own journey to see them.\" \"I'd like to see how beautiful the wild flowers are.\"",
        "Gladiator's Triumphus": "A helmet of the gladiator adorned with feathers. To zealous spectators, this helmet was the symbol of invincibility. The legendary gladiator had fought numerous battles. None had ever stood a chance of survival before his sword, be they human or monster. On each triumphant day, the champion gladiator would walk through the gate to a hero's welcome from the adoring crowd. Only in moments of victory could the slave have a taste of what it felt like to be a master. But the cost of this vain aspiration was for the faint glow of freedom to be shrouded by darkness. On the day of his triumph, the gladiator finally caught a glimpse of the world outside his cell. He was a step closer to freedom. But only when his helmet fell down on the arena floor did he and the spectators alike realize that it was all just a farce. The offering of his petty life made no difference. He would always be a worthless slave in the eyes of his master."

        "Golden Bird's Shedding": "When the sea breeze ebbed, the pink glow of dusk suffused the skies. The seabirds never tarry where the thousand masts are anchored, leaving only scattered feathers in their wake. The once-harmonious and magnificent symphony had its closing moment, just as no empire may rule in peace forever. As the waters expanded, power brought not only progress and order, but arrogance, violence, and exploitation also. In the distant city of the \"people of bygone times,\" in the valley of the hidden exiles, even at the foot of Mount Capitolium ... The noble musicians who tuned the strains and the army of iron in glimmering mail came to take everything from the people. Those who were yet unconquered and the mighty who had yet to have a drop of water taken from them banded together, swearing to resist to the last. \"It is as I feared, and it is as I mourned, my brother . While you sang on high, you should have heard the voices of the lowly also.\" \"Not all would willingly see their homes and nature stolen from them. Not all can accept our melody.\" \"You once called them the 'people of bygone times,' brother. But even those who pledge loyalty to the past have determination and dignity that cannot be lightly ignored.\" \"We once thought to conquer and dominate others, but how could the glory of our radiant kingdom\u2014\" \"Weakness! Weakness! That craven compassion of yours darkens your mind. It has made your heart soft, it has become an exposed weak spot in your back!\" \"Should barbarism and ignorance yet linger in Fontaine , poisoning any of its waters, we shall exterminate them.\" \"If the savages should wish to join our majestic golden order, then we shall accept them, just as our glorious lord accepted us.\" \"But since Bane Dragon Scylla destroyed our towers and slaughtered our musicians, the envenomed, feral tribes are no longer worth saving or accepting.\" \"And since they are unworthy, they must be purged from the soil and the waters, just as we purged pestilence and wildfires from the land.\" It was at this very moment that the golden era suddenly ceased, plunging down into ceaseless war and rebellion. The throne chamber was filled with cries of conquest and destruction and the agony of the barbarian tribes, and the God King awoke, startled.",
        "Golden Era's Prelude": "The sea breeze at dawn, rapturous and free, sings this ancient hymn\u2014 Time flowed forward no longer, but returned to the past with the singer. Along the waters it flowed, passing the gilded domes of the glorious kingdom , On the soft summer wind it passed through the green manor ringed by towering walls. Whether aristocrats in their light ships, or barbarians brought as captives, All were intoxicated by the music of a beautiful age, immersed in the memories... For this was the golden world of abundance \u2014 an era of a righteous, glorious king. \"I came from a puny realm on a lone isle. I was born in a hut, and I grew up in a village built of reeds and grass.\" \"When the warriors in their bright mail came to my home, they announced the news of 'conquest.'\" \"I was but a mere youth, and I naively followed these towering demigods to the capital.\" \"It was by dint of my agile fingers and bright voice that I evaded the fate of bondage.\" \"Only after the God King recognized me did I first witness the might of civilization and order.\" \"Let my flesh and bone, then, be utterly changed. Let my name and tribe be forsaken. The world shall know only the name ' Boethius '!\" And thus was the child born of barbarism moved by the golden palace, and became a servant of a majestic authority. Like one newborn, he worked to abandon the ancient savage customs and devoured new knowledge... All he did, he did to transform himself into a person of true honor and glory, into a part of this great civilization. For nothing else did he toil, for this was the golden world of abundance \u2014 an era of a righteous, glorious king enthroned.",
        "Golden Night's Bustle": "The peaceful sea surged, sending the ship sliding between the silent manor and the temple. Under the pale moonlight, the golden dome that had seemed so glorious in the daytime lost its luster. The God King awoke with a start from his majestic dream. The clear starlight had fled. Violence and estrangement formed a darkness deeper than darkness, shrouding the great dome. In terror and remorse did he summon to him his most loyal guards and most attuned musicians, And he gave them his final orders , intending to bring peace back to the fractured lands... Yet, just as a flood unleashed cannot be held back, the deeply ingrained arrogance and prejudice could not be reversed in a night, and crushed the Harmosts and rulers... All the noble sacrifices, all the unselfish plans \u2014 all fell to ruin at the hands of the wicked , and all came crashing down in the end. Whether the barbaric armies of the Fell Dragon Prince , or the God King determined to the last to save the empire, They were swept away by an inexorable storm \u2014 even the luxurious palace and the jade-green manor were consigned to destruction together... Without the guiding golden song, the once-noble people of the glorious kingdom transformed into disfigured golems ... When the final cacophony of the golden night faded to calm, the Harmost Boethius lay amidst the rubble, Only the rubble heard his insensate mumblings, and only the debris recorded the sin of treachery... \"In a moment of madness, he betrayed us all.\" \"Order will not easily change, nor will human regrets.\"",
        "Golden Song's Variation": "The song of fate once wound through the waterways, spreading the harmonious melody of civilization and order. Wherever the notes fell, brutality was replaced by enlightenment, and disordered primordial land had all but been completely transformed. The mighty sea wind rolled across, and the rootless water lilies floated along with it. In a tribal dwelling as short-lived as seagrass, a young musician met a warrior. Amidst the poems of conquest that are as many as the stars themselves, this song is not that noteworthy, But the waves bore witness to the friendship between the warriors, and also foretold their end. The young musician had yet to be rid of the vulgar passions of the barbarians , and became fast friends with the servant, one of the conquered. That servant's name, no one remembers, but in latter days, the moniker \" Cassiodor \" would become famous the world over. Later, the young warrior would follow the youthful musician to golden Capitolium, the highest city in the golden capital . There they completed the rigorous courses and trials, and were elevated by the golden God King to become prideful masters. \"Pride blooms upon the breast of the citizens of this glorious kingdom as a golden flower. No more poverty or savagery shall there be beneath the God King's sweeping gaze.\" \"Pride is the shield of the realm's honor, and it is the spear-tip with auric radiance. It defends the God King's unsurpassed authority.\" \"Only under the command of such authority can order be born, and where order reigns, art and beauty can bloom free.\" \"In the beautiful golden land, weakness, folly, and savagery will never be accepted or defended \u2014 such things may submit, or be destroyed.\" \"My friend, my brother, do not hanker for that impoverished past, and let not your mind linger on the false, lowly dignity of those peoples of bygone times.\" \"You have forsaken that simple body and feeble spirit, and you have become as pure as steel . Why lament the little things so?\" \"My friend, my brother, listen to that unchanging melody , the clockwork rhythm of your innermost heart \u2014 thus does the God King whisper to you.\" \"The glorious kingdom has eyes only for the perfect world of the future, and this future will, for the people of bygone times, play the final song for their inevitable destruction.\"",
        "Golden Troupe's Reward": "In the solemn silence of the sea's depths , the towering city of the glorious kingdom once stood, And there, like the sad ghost of a mighty, ancient dream, there stands a faded golden castle . The majestic opera of that golden era has ended, and its harmonious, united music no longer echoes. Upon the wreckage of ambition and betrayal, the \"people of bygone times\" built a realm anew. \"Woe, woe to the perfect order, that has once again been trampled by barbarity. The weak and benighted have overtaken the empire's ancient lands!\" \"The spirits and the springs, the springs and the chevaliers... The ravings of children have replaced the epic poems, slipshod ditties have supplanted music.\" \"The eternal majesty was ruined by a moment of the God King 's madness, and the resurgent savages scorn its memory...\" \"Must great realms be reclaimed by savagery in the end? In the end, shall folly and ignorance prevail over civilization and reason?\" Upon the golden theater in that faded castle, thus did musicians who had lost their score cry lamentation for a past that would never return, And the silent, famished golems listened, waiting to hunt and devour the innocent souls. When the great golden symphony plays once more, the Golden Troupe will receive the rightful rewards owed to the true and loyal. When the perfect order separates humanity into master and servant, prosperity and beauty shall make the kingdom glorious once more... Abide until that day... Abide until that day... When every member of the Golden Troupe shall win the whole future as their prize."

        "Copper Compass": "A bronze compass used by a seaman. In an ever-tumultuous life of wandering, It points toward the direction where its owner's heart lies. The rough Skipper once used this compass to guide his huge ship, Navigating treacherous ocean paths and conquering huge whirlpools. It also guided the one whose deep hatred hid behind an uninhibited laugh, And who, lost and despondent, sought death and burning drink... \"I believe you all sing that the thief could not avoid the gallows in the end, eh?\" \"As long as you have a place to belong to, even ending up in the belly of a fish would be alright\u2014\" \"Hey now, didn't you sign a contract with this ship when you came aboard?\" \"That memory didn't get washed down with the wine, did it?\" \"Good, then \u2014 after all, it is time to fulfill your contract.\" \"Is that so? ...Well, alright.

The great warship raised its anchor and headed out to sea, and the Chief Mate once more left harbor with the Skipper . For the Skipper's absurd pursuit, and for his own faded memories, The Chief Mate hummed a crappy shanty of his own composing, forming a chorus with the whales and the waves. \"The scoundrel who gave up his family name and the witch who hunted him (never) reached the sea!\" \"The wise step-brother who could not be an heir became head at last (or did he?)\" \"Words that cannot be sung... Have I also forsaken the truth for illusions?\" \"Having lost it all, and given it all up, and then sinking beneath the waves...\" \"...Maybe this isn't the worst of endings, after all. Hahahahaha!\"",
        "Goblet of Thundering Deep": "A faded, but finely-crafted wine cup, Ground down by the sands in the sea's depths. The exquisite cup fell from the Chief Mate 's hand, raising tiny ripples as it hit the ocean surface. What did it see amid the schools of fish in the dying light? What had he encountered amidst the silent alleys, before the bars of the flower-inlaid windows of a secret tryst? Down and down the dark gold cup sank, into the dreams of the sea monster, and into the dreams of the Chief Mate... \"Someday, I will return the favor for this mark of humiliation that you left upon me.\" The moonlight illuminated sapphire eyes and that striking scar. In his memory, her countenance grew brighter, beautiful, cold and proud, But he had forgotten what he had said then, and grew suddenly despondent as a result. \"Come to think of it, how many times have I forgotten the past ...\" \"Ha, does it matter how you retell the past?\" \"All deaths are in vain. There is no saving that which has already sunk.\"",

The cynical Chief Mate was no native of Liyue . Rather, he came from a gray land ruled by an aristocracy . All said that he, too, was once such a noble, but that he must have disgraced his house and been turned out as a result. That was but baseless hearsay, however, for when he first came to the harbor, he carried naught but a slim sword , And a small sapphire-blue feather pinned to his mantle. Later, the wanderer would throw in with the Skipper and set out to sea, contending with great waves and sea creatures alike. That once azure-blue feather would also be stained red by blood and by the salt of the great ocean. In his last moment, He clearly recalled those days now drowned in drink. Like treasure in the sand brought to light by the lapping waves...",

The hard-drinking Chief Mate was lost in a drunken reverie from morning till night, and was rarely ever sober. He reeked of alcohol all over, mumbling often of tattered memories. The jovial Skipper did not reprimand him, however, and indeed kept giving him important responsibilities. \"Well, we are both people without a thing to our names, eh? Hahahaha!\" \"The wine-sodden sea hat was thrust by a storm into the sky, and then carried away on the roiling waves\" \"Those fated to lose their homelands engage in battles bereft of hope and want\" \"That which they lost to the sea of memory, they sought to reclaim from the deep\" \"The wind and waves are correct.

The wanderer did not know that he had any faculties for dreaming, Thinking that this must have been the researchers' little trick, Or perhaps it was the infinitesimal resistance of that bygone heart. \"You once acquired the 'heart' that you always dreamed of,\" \"But it was but a mere prop for lies and deception.\" \"Now, you will finally obtain what belongs to you ,\" \"And this false construct of a body can at last aspire to power over this world.\" \"Yet, this is all but a fleeting dream of glory.\" \"And it will all one day drift away amidst the sighs of a suffering earth...\" Was it a \"him\" from the past who said this?

These were, once upon a time, the five branches of the Raiden Gokaden , But today, only Amenoma still maintains its line of succession. While the Isshin line can just barely be said to have extant descendants. In the eyes of the people, this is just the natural result of the ravages of time. They never once suspected that such sudden falls from grace might have some hidden mystery behind them. The wanderer would never admit to this. He would never admit that he had done this as an act of revenge against the bladesmith . Nor would he ever mention the truth, That he had abandoned his schemes halfway because they had suddenly become dull. He would only say, in that tone of voice he had learned from a certain researcher : \"It was all just a little experiment into human nature.\" In Inazuma's traditional theater, there is a certain character known as \"Kunikuzushi.\" Such characters are often schemers and usurpers of nations. At the end of his wanderings, he chose this name as an act of his own will. And as for the name he had once used, even he no longer remembered it. It is a norm in Inazuma's traditional theater to join the names of a play's three acts together to form the play's name. For example, \"Sumirezome,\" \"Sangetsu,\" and \"Kogetsukan\" come together, Thus forming the play \"Sumirezome Sangetsu Kogetsukan.\" Perhaps a day will come when this body's adventures, its experiences, Will become tales to be passed along by mortals, distant memories that flow through the ley lines.

The kind young deputy said: \"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun ,\" \"But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind,\" \"Never to reveal your identity to others.\" The upright Inspector said: \"This gold ornament may be a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,\" \"But you are neither man nor mechanism,\" \"And so I can only deal with you in this fashion. Do not hold this against me!\" The wanderer who has left yesterday in the dust no longer thinks about it, But when he covers his ears, he can still hear the wild winds that roared that year. A pair of expectant eyes said: \"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,\" \"It must surely be able to save the people.\" The intelligent, lovely shrine maiden said: \"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,\" \"And she will not abandon you.\" \"As for me, I shall do my best to send for help immediately...\" ...But in the end, the golden arrow-feather were covered in dust, And all tales were incinerated in karmic flames till nothing remained.",
        "Skeletal Hat": "\"Where are you going, wanderer ?\" The roving youth was stopped by a child's shout. That was a child of a Tatarasuna crafts-person, and while he was ill, his eyes were still clear. The youth told the child that he was bound for Inazuma City . \"But it's raining really hard right now. They say that the people who left haven't returned!\" The youth opened and closed his mouth a few times... But at last could only give the child a small smile. The next time he set foot upon that island, that child was nowhere to be found. \"Where are you going, Inazuman? This boat is not for you!\" The wandering young man was halted at the harbor by a boatman. But before the youth could draw his blade, a man in his company stopped him. The man told the mariner that the outlander youth was with him. \"Ah, so he's your guest, sir? My apologies for my presumption.\" The man gave the youth a coat to keep the cold out, but the youth shook his head. He had no need of such things \u2014 he only wished to know what interesting things he might find on this long journey. \"Lord Harbinger . Where are you headed?\" The youth, hating chatty humans the most, gave his subordinate a backhand slap. But he also loved watching expressions of terror and helplessness play across human faces, And it was perhaps precisely because of this imbecilic underling's expressiveness that he had kept them around. He told the groveling, quailing figure that they were headed east, for Mondstadt . \"I understand! I'll get your bodyguards ready right now!\" He had no need of guards, of course, but he was lazier still to barter words with cretins. Donning his wanderer's hat, he headed eastward alone. \"Child, where are you going?\" Returning home, the youth was stopped at the roadside by an old woman. He told her that he was going west. \"To Yashiori Island , then? What business are you on?\" She had said this thoughtlessly, knowing only that things had not been peaceful of late. The youth thanked her for her concern with earnest smile and told her that he was bound for an appointed meeting. As the boat gradually approached the shore, a lady in foreign garb could be seen standing by the shoreline, And she threw a small crystal sphere at the youth from afar. Catching it with ease, he lifted it up to the dying, bloodied sun.",

In her latter works, she would also consign designs that might store such a heart to obsolescence. Not long after, that noblest and most prestigious \"proof\" in the world would come to have no home, And thus was sent to the great shrine at Mt. Yougou . Later, the beautiful puppet awoke and began his wanderings. He observed many a heart, Good ones, upright ones, strong ones, gentle ones... The puppet, too, desired a heart. Later, the lovely puppet would finally obtain that \"heart.\" It was, after all, his purpose for being, the very reason he existed. Yet, it was not what the puppet truly desired, For it did not contain any blessings, But was instead a sacrifice brimming with selfishness, hypocrisy, cunning and curses, All wrapped in an amiable husk. Good and evil were the song of sentient life, useless and cacophonous. But if he were to wrench this \"heart\" out, He would no longer be able to feel anything at all..."

Legend has it that the Lavawalker would drink lava from this goblet as if it were a glass of fine wine. But while fine wine evaporates in high heat, the wisdom of the sage could withstand a trial by fire. To the Lavawalker, fine wine was merely a catalyst in the process of producing ingenuity. Aided by alcohol, even the slightest spark can combust into a brilliant idea. The goblet was a silent witness to the forging of wisdom amidst the flames.

But this short retreat bought little relief from his burning torment. During his time as a secluded sage, the Lavawalker could not bear the eternal scorch. He crafted this hourglass to mark the passing of time. As the flames blazed, burning sand flowed endlessly through the hourglass day after day. Sadly, though the Lavawalker did not fear the scorching flames of the Mare Jivari, he could not quench the torturing flames of time. The anguish of being left alone without the disciples and family he held so dear burned away at his soul more than any flames could ever scorch his flesh.",

        "A Horn Unwinded": "When the horns proclaimed the northern realm 's might, thunderous footsteps shook the earth; Like iron rails stretching across the frozen tundra, sending pale flames shooting across the land. A contingent , sworn to Her Majesty the Tsaritsa , whose loyalty lay with no single Harbinger , Vowed to forge a pure new world beneath the white, glimmering stars. Even those dwelling in the borderlands , autonomy being bestowed upon them, remained children of the motherland; For in her boundless love, the Tsaritsa abandoned none who chose to follow. Since his earliest years, the Warrant Officer who led this border squad had held this conviction firm, Until he hovered before the very gates of hell and glimpsed those souls unloved by any. The request to strike had yet to be sanctioned, but he had already made up his mind: We journeyed this far to save innocents beset by merciless calamity; How could we stand by as those pitch-black beasts devour the land, snatching away the lives of mothers and their children? If this was what those in power called an order, then to hell with it. ... Thus was the foul miasma swept away by the northern winds, just as the first light of dawn pierces the coal-black clouds, its glow once more cast down upon the cerulean earth below. The war had ended, yet to the high tower no triumphant hero returned; only a criminal, and the children he had risked all to save. Though the plan had strayed slightly from its course, the renegade doctor paid it no heed, for the goal had been achieved. Desertion, treason against the Tsaritsa \u2014 grave crimes indeed, yet absolved by a newly-sworn oath.

Originally engaged as spies, the family was elevated to the gentry by the Winter Tsar ; And thus did this man of humble origin step into the royal palace , now mingling among the fae dignitaries of the court. When the nations found themselves swept up by that calamity , the frontier regions \u2014 once the locus of high hopes during the pioneering age \u2014 found themselves bereft of the gods ' protection. In Nod-Krai 's darkest hour, from the north came only a single rider clad in dark silver armor. As if knowing why he had come, the maiden of the new moon lit a beacon to dispel the darkness. On the eve of their departure for the Lempo Isles to the south, a grand banquet was held for the warriors in the great mead hall. Of those present, the most striking was undoubtedly a certain young warrior, clad in a dark tasseled helmet, polearm clutched in hand. Among the Ratniki of the time, few are those who still wore such archaic, cumbersome armor, For it symbolized their bloodline as descendants of those warriors who first fought alongside the Torchforger to repel the black tide . Despite having neither fief nor noble title, they continued to uphold the oaths of their ancestors, For they believed that somewhere out there, the lord of all fae and erstwhile protector of all Snezhnaya watched over them still. Amidst the sludge-sullied tundra, now soaked too in the blood of heroes, the young warrior knelt among the bodies of his fallen comrades. Sacrifice had always been the Ratnik's fate and honor; but if he could save one more soul, rescue just one other, then all the better. And so, like his ancestors before him, he prayed to an old god that no one now called upon, as well as to the Knyazes he had once held dominion over. Perhaps awakened by the sound of the horn, or drawn by the long-forgotten scent of bloodshed, or maybe just out of boredom, Somewhere out there, as if in answer to his pleas, a long-dormant phantom stirred from slumber.

In the end, even that pretentious lunatic could not break free of the celestial shell , and was consumed by the bedeviled sky at the edge of delusion. But all this took place before the \"paradise\" had even come into being, For at the time, it was no more than a daydream, a fantasy shared by two children beneath the moon's glow. It was not until many years later, when one of them was executed as a notorious bandit , infamous throughout the nations, That the other finally realized the true meaning of those words that had been left behind as if by accident. What followed, we all know. When the long night fell, the royal court of the north could no longer mind the remote borderlands beyond the snowy plains, And so the horde of pitch-black beasts tore across the barren land, destroying all traces of past civilization. It was not until, borrowing power from the priestess of the Moonchildren, the original Torchforger raised that first beam of light, And in the name of the moon, banished the darkness to those lightless ruins, burying it deep down alongside the nightmare-torn souls. When all was over, the survivors raised a lighthouse atop the mountains, gazing far out towards the new ruler of Snezhnaya . To preserve his dear friend's pure, childlike dream, the Torchforger did not shy away from defending it before the Tsaritsa 's court. And though he received the royal edict he sought, he also took upon himself an oath of vigilance and sacrifice; And thus began the history of the \"paradise\" known as \" Nod-Krai .\"",
        "Nightingale's Tail Feather": "Legends told of a nightingale, carrying an ember in its beak, that flew only on moonless nights. A speck of fire that would streak across the firmament like a shooting star; a light in dark times. Upon the ancient ruins of a castle, a vestige of an age of pioneers, stood the high tower of the \" Lightkeepers ,\" standing guard through the long night. Centuries had passed since their ancestors had stood before the Tsaritsa , swearing an oath of eternal fidelity, And the people living in \" paradise \" believed that, so long as their lighthouse stayed lit, they could live in freedom, Neither fearing the chaos wrought by the pitch-black beasts , nor needing to seek refuge in the lands to the north. Then one night, a chilling sound carried over the horizon's edge \u2014 the leader of the Wild Hunt was abroad, galloping across the night sky. As ever, the night watchers laid down their great animal skin cloaks; yet that day, the sun rose not. As the rallying horns echoed through the hills, warriors formed ranks at the high tower's foot, Awaiting that momentous command to march south in fulfillment of their ancient vows. Yet in the great mead hall, the current Starshyna sat in silence; For already, a mighty host bright as midsummer's day had reached the city gates to the north. \" Warriors of the Pale Star , why do you choose this moment to knock at Piramida 's gates?\" \"Even you have no right to revoke the sacred powers bestowed upon us by Her Majesty the Tsaritsa.\" Though they claimed to be reinforcements, these uninvited guests had ulterior motives, as the Starshyna knew full well; But to yield at this juncture would spell the end of the autonomy they had upheld for centuries past. From beneath the lead officer's mask came a voice, low and cold, And in its wake a mocking laugh from parts unknown. \"That is where the dark calamity began. Remember, Snezhnaya cannot bear the weight of your defeat.\" \"Warriors of the Nightingale, fight with all your might! Yet, should none of you return...\" \"Then we will take care of the 'aftermath.'\"",
        "Undying One's Mourning Bell": "The air was thick with the scent of blood, as if signaling the return of the great war by which the earth had been scorched. With a great mournful wail, that army of spirits flew across the pitch blackness of the night sky. According to the folk tales spread through the countryside, they were said to be a demonic host from another world seeking a harvest of souls. Others believed them to be the lingering phantoms of that ancient nightmare. This was the calamity that the people of the borderlands refer to as the \" Wild Hunt .\" If it had been no more than a summer storm, ravaging the sky with thunder and lightning, It might have seemed a small mishap to those accustomed to a life of adventure. But when that tempest, the likes of which had not been seen for a century, poured down upon the earth like black-blood rain, Only then did the people realize that these terrifying legends, which had been passed down by their ancestors, Were not mere stories meant to frighten children, but born instead of a terror that coursed through their very veins. But in the end, it was a terror that someone had to face, lighting the way for the souls wandering through the boundless dark. A black-feathered flock of crows moved between the realms of light and shadow, led by one who stood against the light. His sword he silently raised, the face reflected in its sheen as sharp and unyielding as the blade itself. Onward pressed the oath-bound legion , though they knew they were as moths to a flame, marching onto that battlefield from whom none would return. ... At the end of the path, only the one who held the dark blade still stood. He knew that deep within the forest lurked the foul force by which the \"Wild Hunt\" had been summoned forth. Just a little more, a little further, and he would have saved the land he had sworn to protect. Lost in his thoughts, he failed to notice that his body had already been torn asunder, And that the warning bell he carried rang out hissing amidst the tearing of blood and black muck. Perhaps frightened by its unsettling chime, the carrion feeders around him faltered, frozen in their tracks. Thus was he left to walk alone in the abyss, to fulfill an as-yet unfulfilled oath... As many years went by, a new addition was woven into the folklore of the land: That, whenever mournful bells toll, it is a sign that the one who swore to hunt down the Wild Hunt is approaching."

        "Lucky Dog's Clover": "One who is favored by fortune tends to experience at least their fair share of miracles. The legendary four-leaf clover, for instance, is a precious find that brings luck to its bearer. Once, while playing in the field, the carefree young boy known as Lucky Dog happened across just such a clover. Delighted, he plucked it from the ground and put it in his pocket. No one knows whether it was the clover which brought him his good fortune, or the other way around.",
        "Lucky Dog's Eagle Feather": "When fortune has your back, even the most ferocious monster has to yield. Strolling in the forest, the boy known as Lucky Dog had no idea that a monster was lurking nearby, having singled him out as its prey. The boy became distracted by some colorful mushrooms, and the monster pounced. He leaped out and landed on the poisonous mushrooms, stomping them flat. This was going to be an easy hunt, the monster thought \u2014 until a feather from the eagle circling above fell quietly onto its back.",
        "Lucky Dog's Goblet": "Once there was a child favored by fortune from the day he was born. Try as they might, even the most vicious bandits could not lay a finger on him. He became known as Lucky Dog. The child grew up, and one day in the throes of adulthood he found himself stumbling drunk along the back alley behind the tavern. Under the starless sky, a vicious bandit prepared to rob Lucky Dog, taking advantage of his compromised state. But just as the bandit was about to strike, a flying goblet hit him square on the forehead, knocking him out cold. Naturally, this makes Lucky Dog one of very few people known to have benefited, rather than suffered, from being in the vicinity of a tavern brawl.",
        "Lucky Dog's Hourglass": "Even time itself could not leave a wrinkle on the face of the happy-go-lucky boy known as Lucky Dog. Lucky Dog had no family, let alone children of his own. But in the course of his life of good fortune, he considered all he met as his friends and family. As his life was nearing its end, he saw an hourglass with sand flowing down, as if counting down his remaining time. He simply chuckled, took a slingshot, and shattered the hourglass.",
        "Lucky Dog's Silver Circlet": "One who is favored by fortune can find priceless treasures in the most deadly of traps. While wandering around some ruins, the boy known as Lucky Dog accidentally fell into a deep pit. He landed safely on a pile of dust. It turned out to be a mattress that over the years had gradually broken down, eventually turning to dust. Just like that, Lucky Dog discovered a treasure trove left by the old aristocrats. This circlet came to epitomize his luck."

Just like that passage the maiden had read countless times in books: \"The damsel in distress was saved by the white knight in shining armor.\" \"And they exchanged flowers as blessings to one another.\" Though a maiden's heart is said to change with the seasons, just like a flower, This flower remained constant. For her heart had stilled in that moment long ago: The moment that she met the knight.",
        "Maiden's Fading Beauty": "Even when surrounded by flowers from her courters, The maiden never removed her hat to get a better look at them. Their names and faces were not worth remembering. For years, at the end of every day, the maiden would brush off the dust on her hat. But the passage of time showed in her face, too \u2014 and unlike the dust, it could never be brushed off. As time passed, fewer and fewer courters visited her with flowers. What did it matter? For her, time had already stopped long ago on that fateful day.",
        "Maiden's Fleeting Leisure": "The maiden's most cherished teaware. It was once filled with elegant black tea. Indulging herself in pastries and tea, She cared not one bit about the mundane world. This was her privilege as a maiden. \"This flower shall be my medal. That is all I need.\" The knight said to her on the day they met. \"But my heart is already\u2014\" Not finishing her confession was her privilege, but also the chains of courtliness the maiden had to bear.",
        "Maiden's Heart-Stricken Infatuation": "An old but delicate feathered ornament. After many years, it is now covered in layers of dust. For the maiden, time stopped still the day she met the knight . Nothing mattered to her anymore, not even love and youth. She sought him constantly, wandering far like a lost bird without a nest to cling to. \"May my love reach the knight,\" she prayed. Meanwhile, the knight dedicated himself to the pursuit of chivalry. In a distant land where ancient empires crumbled Would the knight see the scenery she dreamt of?",
        "Maiden's Passing Youth": "A delicate timepiece. It stood as a testament to the inevitable passage of time, indifferent to its owner's feeling. The maiden's time would one day come to an end. But her waiting would not. The short hand seemed to be constantly chasing after the long hand. Much like the incessant longing that filled the maiden's heart and mind. Years after the event, she still remembered the knight she met that day. The white knight that came for her. The white knight she had been waiting for ever since."

        "Forgotten Vessel": "Once, this wine vessel belonged to one who rendered great service to the Court of Fontaine . Those who find themselves doing certain work, unless they be born ruthless and cruel, Will eventually walk down the path to total collapse should they go without the elixir within. This belonged to one who had to do what had to be done for Fontaine's peace. It was only many years after he retired due to injury, during his final investigation, that he realized... ...No wonderland lay in welcome down the rabbit hole \u2014 only the maelstrom. ...\nMemories arose like bubbles from a ruptured diving mask. He thought of his youth, of the games he would play with Dwight , Basil , and Karl . In those days, he always played the hero, and Karl would be Jabberwock the evil dragon, He thought of the embrace of the Director , so dear and familiar, and he felt so similarly in this moment. He recalled the countless faces warped by hate in the crimson flames of Poisson , And then he recalled that he, too, had sent innocent children to the Narzissenkreuz Institute . In the end, what came clearest to him was what he had felt upon meeting his \"son\" and \"daughter.\" It was like seeing light at the end of a long tunnel, like seeing himself before he had worn the mask. But much like clinging to a spider's thread futilely in the dark pits of hell\u2014 \"My dear Alain , my dear Mary-Ann ... I was never close to you,\" \"And even at the end, I do not know how I could be a \"father\" to you.\" \"But still, I do not wish to lose these memories of watching the two of you growing up...\" \u2014When he awoke from his stupor, all glories, all shame, all love and obsession \u2014 they had been dissolved in the waters .",
        "Hunter's Brooch": "This emblem was specially designed and given to those who had, in the past, Performed feats of arms in Fontaine's defense. Insignias of this sort were largely symbols of glory, But some awardees would conceal them or consign them to the water. \"Pursue the phantoms in the dark, expel them all, and hunt them down.\" Such is the origin of the name \"Marechaussee Hunter,\" Credited to one Cassiodor , who would be elevated to the revered title of \"Golden Hunter,\" But who saw the name as a humiliation. Yet, heretics and demons are rare, but people who are driven to become heretics and demons are legion. Today, the Marechaussee Phantom is more focused on investigating criminal activity than battle, And has absorbed into its ranks a large number of Melusines , members of a young race. This emblem once belonged to a Marechaussee Hunter who took part in and directed the Siege of Poisson . Due to this event, he left the ranks of the Marechaussee and planned to live out the rest of his days, content with the contents of his cup. It was not until an old friend requested that he, against his will, try living with others again, That he tried to create a world free of dark phantoms for his son and daughter .

Now, regarding Alain Guillotin, Before he joined, then left the Marechaussee Phantom , before finally setting up the Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering , Guillotin organized research into energy at the now-ruined Institute of Natural Philosophy . It is said that he, throughout his life, was close to no one but his younger sister , who also served in the Marechaussee. There are many legends concerning him. One of them is as follows\u2014 It is said that he was able to create a thinking machine during his time at the Institute, And used this machine to aid his sister in her work at the Marechaussee. These statements largely come from previous colleagues of his (most of whom died fighting Elynas ), And since there was no physical evidence of it, it has never entered official record. Once, when asked about this, he commented: \"It's a great shame. There's nothing to be said.\" He never again responded to any questions or inquiries relating to the matter. Another goes as such\u2014 In his old age, he retired from the Fontaine Research Institute to his workshop, and he would see no one. The research he undertook in his final years was never published, And after the matter, the only things that could be found in his personal workshop were signs that something had been built. In latter years, these legends would function similarly to that work of Coppelius's that could not be performed to completion, Stoking imaginations, granting inspiration, and driving ever greater efforts.",
        "Moment of Judgment": "This pocket watch was once given to the enforcers of Fontaine 's justice. It is not a particularly accurate watch, But it can be used as a badge while on duty, And it was once nigh-universally recognized across Fontaine. The news of the Great Magician \" Parsifal \" requesting a trial by combat spread via the newspapers, And this demand, alongside her unexpected transgression , caused quite the furor in the Court of Fontaine . The court's agreement and person of choice caused a yet greater uproar. Champion Duelist Marfisa was selected as the prosecution's representative in the duel. Would Marfisa's origin disrupt either her judgment or performance during the duel? What of her past connection to Parsifal? And most commonly understood... Which of them was the stronger fighter? Such were the questions people reveled in discussing. Karl Ingold , a journalist who once knew \"Parsifal,\" had since retired, And had resolved to never again take up such work, taking instead the company of explorers and their wilds, their wrecks, and their ruins. But perhaps out of professional pride or an old memory, he had always treasured the pictures he took as a journalist.\nYears later, when answering an invitation to meet old friends, sent by the Vice Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute , Upon looking upon the faces on the other side of the shutters as he took a group picture of the then - members of the Narzissenkreuz Institute , He thought of how he had once passed back and forth between Poisson and the Court of Fontaine many times with such hope in his heart. Those several months passed by like a dream \u2014 some would consider that too long, and others, too short. He remembered his younger self, who would not give up, no matter how many people told him to escape, No matter how the circumstances arose like a flood that might end everything and slowly blot out the light. He remembered the many smiles he saw through the viewfinder, all their fanciful thoughts concerning the future he had heard, And afterwards, the cries, sounds of fracturing and metallic clashes that sounded faintly from beyond the stone floor. And as he recalled the girl who used a \"trick\" to forcibly shift herself to a dark, safe cavern, Only then did the regret of not having recorded her final battle engulf his vision.",
        "Veteran's Visage": "This mask was given to one whose face was wounded in service to the Court of Fontaine . It is a replacement for an appalling visage \u2014 the glory, or perhaps the shame, of an old soldier. Yet even though the scars can be covered, the wounds laid on one's heart will not disappear. \"If I do not return, I leave those two kids to you.\" His friend said to him \u2014 she with whom he had grown up, and served the Court of Fontaine together. I've stopped asking you to fight alongside me, she wanted to say, But today, the tacit understanding between them was a blank span of years. So long as they didn't discuss it, it was almost as if the Poisson incident had never happened. The Institute might be drowned for certain this time, and things won't be safe without myself and the Director , And so it might be better to entrust the children to trustworthy people like yourself and Ingold , His friend explained, seeing the look he was giving her, mute beneath that mask. \"When I return in triumph, let's invite Lasker and Ingold for a get-together.\" \"I'll cook this time. I'll show you lot my skills.\" Seeing the suspicion in his eyes, she added this on in a huff\u2014 \"Hey, I've picked up baking these past few years! The children love it!\" \"Well, guess it's goodbye, Guillotin... My dear Emanuel .\" \"Hope everything goes smoothly on your end. Don't get yourself in trouble, now.\" \"I do hope that those brats haven't wrecked my Sponsian just yet...\" He had no love of children \u2014 indeed, he wished to have no dealings with anyone, For all seeing people did was remind him that they, too, had red blood flowing within them.

It also represents the high ambition the young martial artist once had. Before the first crack of dawn, the young martial artist was already training in the forest. Many years later, the martial artist is now an instructor . Though youth may be a thing of his past, he remains just as alert and diligent as when he was young.",

The martial artist will wear the feather on his chest as proof of his unparalleled skills.",

Each of them faced with a worthy opponent, two martial artists will raise their glasses to one another. They then step into the arena with a calm and collected composure to face their opponent with the utmost respect. This is the true meaning of the toast, which comes before the fight takes place. It does not serve to glorify victory or cast shame on defeat."

        "Bloom of the Mind's Desire": "Those were the days when the sinners had yet to commit their unforgivable offense, somewhere deep within the earthly subterranean kingdom . The people of the kingdom had never seen the sea, nor had they ever seen the real sun. But even in this dark, sunless place, some tried to reach for the secrets of the stars. However, they gazed not at the stars but sought the truth in the mirror's false reflection. Perhaps because of the kingdom's unique location, strange phenomena often appeared in the star charts within its bounds. These phenomena were recorded by astrologers as \"Signs of Truth,\" reflecting their deep desire to uncover truth. \"Maybe, even if the mirror shows nothing but illusions, it is only by piercing through them that we can reach the truth.\" This was the conclusion the astrologers reached over time as they pored over their voluminous star charts. But unbeknownst to the philosophers of their time, they had already glimpsed a tiny fragment of the infinity that was the eternal bedeviled sky ... Many years passed, long enough for the earthly gods to fall, one by one, and for the atrous sun to rise where the crimson moon once hung. Even then, there were those who had already uncovered the secret behind the great sin, and so, the study of the stars became a forbidden pursuit. Only a select few within the kingdom were then granted the privilege of sidestepping the ban, so they might better serve their one-eyed ruler . Yet the unexpected always finds a way, just like the moment when an unwitting novice monk brushes away the dust that has concealed Apaosha 's mirror, unveiling the wondrous light that encircles the distant horizon and filling that tiny stargazing chamber with brilliance once more. How beautiful the pitch-black Elysium is, how dazzling... and yet how utterly... profane. In the blink of an eye, it consumed young Rauthvangi 's every thought and desire. Thus began the tale and transgressions of the mad monk, who in later days would sing the praises of the abyss beyond the heavens...",
        "Crown of the Befallen": "The northern winds brought new opportunities and the touch of civilization to the ancient borderlands . Where the great trees fell, cities, ports, and factories were built. But only the Tsar 's favorite knew that the prosperity everyone saw was not as it seemed, And that the ruler of the fae now hatched a bold scheme, a revolt that the sublunary order could never tolerate. \"But if you ask me, His Majesty the Tsar could afford to think even bigger, surely.\" \"Bound by the chains of benevolence to this earth, he has never once looked up at the stars.\" \"Such great power, and yet he only seeks to be the ruler of all living things beneath the moon.\" \"Little does he know that the true eternal Elysium he seeks lies beyond the sky's veil.\" The mad monk , serving as the Tsar's envoy, arrived in Nod-Krai on a secret mission. Whoever claimed the treasure hidden here would wield a power capable of turning the world upside down. However, he sought this power not to save the world, but to use it as a means to serve his own ends. \"Look at these foolish, fleeting mortals, as hopeless as this rapidly fading world of illusion.\" \"Only those like me, who have been chosen by the supreme grace, are worthy of living on.\" \"Better to find liberation in sacrifice for a great endeavor than to remain lost in endless cycles of samsara.\" \" Reed Miller , cast your meaningless melancholy aside, for you and I have been chosen by fate.\" \"Come, follow me. Though the world is destined for destruction, we shall emerge from the celestial shell !\"",
        "Feather of Indelible Sin": "To overstep the bounds of one's station is already lese-majeste, And to delve into forbidden dark knowledge is an even graver offense. But Rauthvangi never once defended himself, for in his heart he held nothing but that light. Soon, the court delivered its verdict: the researcher was to be expelled from the Universitas Magistrorum and exiled. For one of outland stock like him, exile was even more terrifying than the punishment of death. Exile was, after all, an ancient curse for those who had turned their backs on the gods, and once they returned above ground, that malison would catch up with them swiftly. A punishment like this was itself already a betrayal of the kingdom 's noble ideals, a sign that the underground realm was in decline. But royal orders had to be obeyed. Besides, he who had glimpsed Elysium's depths knew all too well that he could no longer endure what lay ahead. \"Fade away, o meaningless life. At least you glimpsed truth, if for but one moment.\" Rauthvangi finally emerged from the cavern, stepping into real sunlight. Yet, nothing happened to him \u2014 unlike the others beside him, who now shrieked in agony. It was as if the great existence of the cosmos had manifested before him in that instant, And chosen, above all others, to bestow upon him the grace of darkness. Fortunately, tragically, he finally came to realize his mission. \"Flames illuminate the world \u2014 but they are also what reduce it to ashes.\" \"And my fate is like that of a moth leaping into the flame.\"",
        "Revelation's Toll": "It was a time before the dark disaster engulfed the nations, A time when people still savored those last golden years. It is said that there was an erudite and gifted researcher who wandered the nations for many years. He had already read every Rtawahist chronicle, browsed the libraries of the northern lands. However, even after searching in the oldest records, he could not find what he was looking for\u2014 That pitch-black Elysium \u2014 miraculous, and not of this world. He had traveled to every corner of the known world, save for that barren, still-undeveloped land. That was the northern borderland known as Nod-Krai . It had only been a few years ago that the Tsar of Snezhnaya ordered it to be explored and put to use. No famous researchers dwelled there, nor did it seem to contain any traces of ancient civilizations. \"O futile life that I have led! This shall be my final post.\" He thought before setting off for Nod-Krai. \"Hope may be gone, but I cannot give up now.\" Once more, he glimpsed the truth he had long pursued... Perhaps because his wish had finally been heard and heeded. And at last, he uncovered the sinful path that opened into the pitch-black Elysium. Now, all that remained was for him to open the gate \u2014 one that had shone in countless dreams \u2014 with his own two hands, No matter the means, and no matter the price that had to be paid...",
        "Vessel of Plenty": "In the rotating galleries of Zapolyarny Palace , the banquets and dances never seemed to stop. The fae nobles, fond of luxury, considered attending banquets their most important duty. Even the hardest heart could be softened by the rich aroma of fine wine... And many important affairs of state, both great and small, were often decided by those in a slight tipsy haze. Professor Rotwang , whom the nobles called the \"mad monk\" in private, had attended court rather frequently of late. This was not just because he had become the Tsar 's favorite through his mastery of alchemy and astrology, Nor simply because he constantly uttered profound aphorisms that inevitably sent everyone in the room into laughter. What truly made the nobles sit up and take notice was the legends surrounding him. It was said that the Grand Duke Photius once, out of envy, sought to get rid of this troublesome viper. He replaced the fine fire-water with a deadly poison... But to his astonishment, the good professor appeared completely unaffected after drinking it. In the end, the grand duke himself took a knee to the monk, even becoming the latter's most devoted follower. Another tale had it that Filipov , the most adept of the fae at the art of transformation, once publicly called the professor's research nothing more than an elaborate hoax. The mad monk responded to the accusation with naught but a calm smile. Then, before everyone's eyes, he summoned the soul of Filipov's late wife, who had been appearing in the bereaved fae's dreams. These tales became a favorite topic of chatter at banquets. But whenever someone tried to confirm their truth, the professor remained silent. Perhaps no one truly cared whether these stories were true. Maybe they only existed to entertain banquet guests between songs and dances. Or perhaps, to the nobles, an outlander with no local ties was more worthy of their trust. Of course, it would be even better if he could assist them with a few niggles. But how could mere actors in this drama have foreseen the tragic denouement's coming?"

The heroes of the stories always had to endure countless hardships before reaching their destination, but the prices they paid and things they lost along the way only made the hard-won rewards all the more precious. \"In the mirror, I saw that everyone no longer loved me, and maybe even detested me. Even just getting them to smile at me once more would be unimaginably difficult... But that is the real world. Full of changes and unpredictable.\" \"No, you can't! The fortune the magic gave you has to make you happy, otherwise...\" \"What are you so worried about? Even if you stop loving me like the others after the magic fades, I will still love all of you.

If she is destined not to be released, then let me go to her. I once saw the many universes and countless stories within the ink bottle. Perhaps one of them has a place for the two of us, and perhaps I too can become a good character...\" \"I remember! Let's tell this story to Mother tonight, do you think she'll like it?\" Pie ignored the little girl, instead standing up and barking a few times before running around in circles and then down out of the attic. \"Hmph!

        "Faithful Hourglass": "... \"If there was a magic pen... What would you write, Pie? Lots and lots of doggie biscuits?\" The girl put down the book and scratched Pie behind the ears. The dog happily wagged its tail in response. \"Oh! You can't write, can you, Pie? Then I'll write for you. Other than lots of doggie biscuits, we'd also...\" She turned to the next page... \"How risible! As though a blue ribbon was something rare!\" The young girl threw the guests out without hesitation, tossing their gifts into a corner. Sure, she had once been fascinated by ribbons blue as kingfishers, but now, such things could no longer hold her interest. \"Poor child!\" Her mother sighed. The girl was tired of her mother's preaching. Though her luck had been with her for but a short while, she had already easily obtained wealth, and the ease with which she won people's hearts she took for granted. This world naturally revolved around her, did it not? Such thoughts came to her more than once. \"You're my mother. Why can't you love me like the others do?\" Perhaps I don't need a mother that doesn't love me, the girl thought. And so, the girl left her home and family behind her. From then on, she could enjoy the good fortune bestowed by magic, with no need to be troubled by the remonstrations of conscience. She traveled until no scenery felt novel, and no sumptuous meal could make her feel grateful. Her life was like a never-ending ball. Guests came and left, but none tarried on the dance floor too long. She sometimes deliberately mistreated those she called \"friends,\" but no matter how rude her behavior had been, the next day, all was forgiven with smiles all around, and they loved her as much as before. All only gave to her, and none asked for anything in return. ...",
        "Honest Quill": "... \"It's so easy to sell one's soul in the stories... But then souls ought to be cheaper. Why else would people sell them so easily?\" But she knew not what a soul was, for she had never seen one. But afternoon tea and delectable desserts, time spent playing with Pie in the garden, the stories her mother told her before bed... In comparison, these were far more precious. \"Fortunately, we have no wishes we'd need a witch to grant, so we needn't exchange such precious things.\" She turned to the next page... Though he received the witch's promise, the youth could not imagine what it would be like for his wish to come true. If it were a more concrete wish... Well, inexhaustible wealth and the power to subjugate others are easy to imagine. But what of some higher happiness? The youth had heard that the witch possessed many magical items and that she used the power of this strange and extraordinary collection. He could not restrain his curiosity, asking the witch what kind of item could fulfill his wish. \"All words written by the pen dipped in this ink will become reality, and she shall become fate's favorite.\" The youth stared in disbelief as the witch gently shook the ink bottle. Black water rolled within like roiling waves, as though he could see the entire world in which they lived like a lonely island floating amidst the undulating tide, and he could see endless faces and scenery before his eyes, turning like the pages of a picture album... He was so mesmerized that it seemed as though he would fall into the ink bottle through its gaping mouth and drown in those black waters. \"The ink bottle contains everything she can imagine, and all of it will be hers if she so wishes.\" As the pen dipped in ink began to dance across the page, the young girl's fate was changed. She wasn't sure when she had stopped being amazed by the limitless good fortune that followed her everywhere. She no longer needed to worry about anything, for everything turned out the way she wanted, and if she wanted something, it found its way to her, sooner or later, one way or another. Everyone loved her, admired her appearance, praised her virtue, and even those she once thought would never notice her completely changed their attitudes. Gradually, she became accustomed to the words of praise and admiring gazes. Though her appearance was by no means extraordinary and her virtue even more average, fate favored her without reservation. ...",
        "Magnanimous Ink Bottle": "... The little girl read on, as Pie snuggled up next to her. She turned to the next page... It was only a long time after that the young girl learned that her mother was long dead. Returning to her hometown after a long absence, she found that all were courteous and cordial to her, no less than everyone else, whether it was strangers or familiar faces. \"It's all as you wished, so why won't you smile once more?\" The young man who had spoken was someone she had seen before, perhaps just one of the many followers. \"Mother was right, I am a pitiable child. Because of this awful curse, I can never be truly happy.\" \"Ah! You actually consider such a selfless gift a curse. You should know, this was obtained in exchange with a witch, and obtained only through sacrifice! He never even thought about asking anything in return from you. Is there any greater love than that in the world?\" \"Then it seems he knows more than me about how to obtain happiness.\" The girl continued, \"Where is the value in a life in which all is given to you for free, and you never need pay? The most worthless things are those that nobody needs. Perhaps I am the existence which is unneeded.\" \"No, not at all... You must exist! At least, that's how I feel about it.\" \"Then what is it you want from me? If there's something I can do for you...\" But the young man looked embarrassed. The young girl was immeasurably disappointed, and resolved to go to the witch's abode in the Echoing Woods and find a way to break the accursed curse. The youth took out the magic mirror he had loaned from the witch, hoping to stop her. \"When the luck gifted to you by magic is taken away...\" The girl saw before her what awaited when her luck was exhausted: She saw herself lose all her wealth, and those she hurt no longer laughed jovially and forgave her, but scolded her and rolled their eyes. People no longer crowded about her but left as though a great ball had ended. She still traveled as before, but none now showed care or concern for her on her journey. She saw herself blown about by the wind and pummeled by the rain while children laughed at her and mocked her. She saw that all the gifts she had received would have to be repaid tenfold, a hundredfold. Though she hadn't taken a single step, all that she saw in the mirror seemed to be happening to her, and she saw her life become an endless toil conspiring to destroy her. \"Rejoice, for the fortune granted by magic has not yet abandoned you, and none will laugh at your weakness.\" ...",
        "Selfless Floral Accessory": "The little dog ran up to the attic, got a nose full of dust, and couldn't help but have a sneezing fit. \"Come on, Pie, just look at you! You used to be the color of Apple Pie, but now you look more like you've been covered in mulberry jam!\" The little girl pursued the dog named \"Pie\" into the tiny attic, and helped him brush the dust away. The attic was filled with beautifully bound books, and the girl chose one from the shelf. The cover was adorned with beautiful golden-winged butterflies. \"It looks like a storybook. Maybe the stories that Mother likes to tell are from this book! What do you think, Pie?\" The little dog gave a short bark and curled up by her feet as usual. \"Hmph! If I can finish it before Mother...\" And so the girl opened the storybook, and the yellowed pages unfurled like the wings of a butterfly... That was a story that happened not long ago. Legends say that in the Echoing Woods, there lived a witch who could grant any wish. But this witch was just as eccentric as those to be found in other stories. She used magic to cover the entire forest in a thick, impenetrable fog. Any who entered would be confused by the echoes, and so few could find her secluded hut, much less make any wish. But one day, a youth finally knocked on the witch's door. The youth had originally been looking for a blue flower, but his gaze had been drawn by a golden-winged butterfly. As he chased it, he arrived at the witch's hut without realizing it. Only then did he recall the legends of the wish-granting witch, and after hemming and hawing, he finally decided to knock. Before he could knock thrice, the door opened. \"I have a wish...\" Began the youth. \"That's what they all say.\" The witch cut him off, \"For me, granting your wishes is a trifling matter. But the price of said wish is different for everybody.\" \"The girl I love... Her heart already belongs to another. But I do not wish to use the power of magic to change her feelings, I only want her to have all the happiness in the world. If you can grant this wish, I will give you anything I have, my time, my money, even my soul, I willingly offer it all to you.\" \"Your wish will come true. But the price will be paid in the future, and the price won't necessarily be your soul... We witches do what we will.\" \"But what in this world could be more precious than a person's soul?\" \"You'll know when the appointed time comes, that only a heart of gold may be weighed.\" ..."

They were noble not only in lineage, but also in their commitment to virtues and principles. The longevity of the nobles was cut short by their endless self-indulgence.

The first nobles who rose up to rule Mondstadt began as heroes of humble origins. These great chieftains and elegant princes as well as beautiful princesses and noblemen once welcomed the people to their banquets and feasts. In those days long past, the nobles shared their wisdom and elegance generously. In that golden age, the nobles shared with the people their knowledge and profits. But the later nobles were seduced by power. Their banquets were exclusively for their own pleasure.",

Commonplace were the hunts, a hobby of the ruling class of Mondstadt. The festivities were shared with their servants and the common folk, As a sign of the benevolence of the nobles. All the people were eager participants in the festivities. Hunts soon lost their meaning. The nobles everything as their own, presuming it their right.

It was more for self-discipline than a tool to influence the common folk. At daybreak, a worthy noble must be more vigilant than his people. At night, he should be more thoughtful and restless than they. Over the years, the once-strict schedule was overturned by their indolent descendants.

But it is oft-said that heroes who live too long, live to become the evil dragon. And when many stories cross paths, perhaps one side's hero is another side's dragon. The tale that finally emerges will trend toward narratives that are easier to grasp \u2014 which is why heroes are heroes, and not evil dragons. That is why, for all their strength and schemes, the evil dragons will ultimately be defeated by the heroes wielding their holy swords. And before the dragon falls into the chasm that dissolves all things, he will think of the times he once spent with the hero . And at last, he will say: \"Yes, hatred shall not fill me. I know that you have not seen the sights I have, and that is why you wish to stop me.\" \"The star-beasts shall drink the amniotic fluid of the world dry. A hundred years from then, all life on its surface shall be wiped away.\" \"I will surely return to save all souls. Ten years, even a hundred years may pass, but I shall be reborn as a new universe .\" But the hero, victorious over the dragon, will also lose the thing most precious to him during the hunt. He will never again believe in anything that the sum of human knowledge cannot completely grasp and understand, And to the end of his days, he shall conceive of a kingdom powered by machines and energies not derived from the elements .",
        "Heroes' Tea Party": "Even the Narzissen champions would need to rest for a short time along the adventuring road. When the clock sounded, many champions and mages, knights and evil dragons, All forgot for a time the imprisoned princess and the treasures of the domains. The dark clouds that shrouded the distant kingdom's skies temporarily faded away, And the princess amid her agonized wait would turn her gaze from her window. For when the knights depart, so too must the adventure be put on hold. This is the universal rule the Narzissen champions follow, and many other tiny worlds do as well. If one must ask why, then it is because the refreshments made by the Vice Director are far too delicious. It was a gloomy afternoon... but that phrase seems to have little meaning. For the new home she was going to was one that would not see the light of either sun or moon. Here, the first person she met was the tall, pure Director . And though she was even less sure of what to do than the little girl, she still greeted her with an embrace, And got her clothes soaked for the trouble.

Narcissus was infuriated by this, and so sent out his minions and enforcers to scour the empire for her treasure. He set up many defensive mechanisms using his fell sorceries to prevent those on the side of justice from resisting him. He swore that he would reclaim the princess' treasure and reawaken her.

        "Crown of the Saints": "In the era when the dark tide of filth arose from the sky's edge and heroes sun-bright marched forth to conquer, Many stories transpired that were never recorded or eulogized in any human history. When human warriors bid farewell to their secluded villages and brought blessings of the Wayob to once-inaccessible, forbidden realms, The ancient dragons had become extinct from the fields they once ran upon, and the fruitful soil and springs had taken upon new colors. The palaces and temples built upon magma cliffs lost their luster, now silently waiting for the judgment at the end of days, In this dreamlike realm, cut off from the world, the end of the era of the ancients, too, drew nigh. And in the lightless lands of night , the sacred ones continued their dissension over who would deliver this final verdict. He was a hero unprophesied, a champion unaccounted for by any plan. This was a time when the war chiefs of the tribes had abandoned their great cause of slaying wicked dragons, vying power-drunk for supremacy; When their warriors plunged into endless warfare, leaning on savage beasts for support. And in those days from the dark lands rose a king bright as the newborn sun, warm as the budding dawn. He wore a crown woven from golden flowers, wielded a great blade of obsidian, and visited one tribe after another. Disagreements born from blades can only be resolved by the blade, and delusion born from ambition can only be subdued by ambition still greater. And the one who had thought itself master over evolution never imagined that those with strength would give it an answer beyond conquest and slaughter. Under the sun's radiance did the tribes make a pact of armistice, and thus did the sacred ones of the night realm lay their arguments aside and offer him the crown. The dawn of a new era emerged over the horizon, and when that light illuminated the earth, even the beasts of darkness had nowhere to hide.",

All know that brave and wise Chaac took the ever-bright kindling from the hands of the Sage of the Stolen Flame , And that he shared this kindling with his fellow tribespeople, passing the secret of fire on to all who came forth to study it. Bidding farewell to long years of chaos and ignorance, the new sprouts of civilization sprung up once more from untamed wilderness, But within their massive walls, the winged ones who lorded it over all had yet to realize that the wheel of fate had begun to turn. Legend holds that the great Sage who dwelled in the stillness of the floating land knew the answer to all questions in the mortal world, But that even he had no answer to two matters: the end of the living, and the homeward path of the dead. Perhaps it was that the gods of the night realm ruled over the underworld, for they were great foes of the Sage in ancient days, Or perhaps his long-considered plan would crumble should the everlasting flame reconnect with the roots of the earth. Having mastered the majestic primal fire, fearless Chaac and his companions at last defeated that raging, wicked dragon, and founded the first tribe. And yet even ancient heroes could not defy the verdict passed by time, for it is eternal, and so one by one, his companions bade him farewell. At last, only Chaac was left, a veteran of countless battles. His tribe had scattered, and none now sang of his saga. Only in the deepest nights could he hear that call from a faraway realm, as if to reignite the fading flame in his heart. On the last night of his life, he climbed a high mountain to ignite the first flame. He called out, hoping to reunite with his former companions. And the god of the night realm responded.

Though the envoy of dusk was not part of its plan, the path of \"evolution\" did not thus deviate, And through careful selection and cultivation, the tribal heroes it had nurtured had ascended to the stage of competition between all parties. It believed that the strongest amongst them would become the hero who would rule all human tribes dwelling atop the black stone. In his name, they would make a covenant, raise a banner of the blazing sun, and march upon the city of deep wells, that even gods had yet to conquer. On that day, the living corpse on the throne would spit forth flame that could stain the sky red, and the new king would receive the primal fire as a tribute due them for ascension . On that day, the dragons would once more bow before the overlord of two worlds, and the knowledge of countless years of civilization would be open to him.

Yet as it walked through hot springs and valleys that dragonkind had yet to touch, seeing things grown from soil or created, none met its expectations. Until one day, when the fog dispersed in a deep valley , it discovered the creator' s most beloved, and yet the weakest of species, Those who should still have been wrapped in swaddling cloths yet were born in a land where dragons did dance, and so could only eke out survival in the shadow of ancient wings. Though they had long lost their guidance , forgotten their past histories and memories, and lost themselves amidst mountain and wood, they endured still. Marveling at their tenacity, unity, and courage, the sage amongst dragons resolved to grant them the kindling of wisdom, But that precious gift was not without cost. It would civilize these barbarians, but it would also order their destinies. For unlike the plan of that first divine one , what the most sage one brought was the profane path of \"evolution,\" Its far sight had divined that at the end of that path, human blood would be poured into the derelict body of the moribund earth, Merging two species and two bloodlines as one, and thus would an ancient pulse surge through a reborn civilization. Indeed, it would be as the wisest one said unto the first barbarian who climbed upon the floating landmass to visit it: \"But from your heirs shall come the savior of two worlds . He shall be brutal as the lions and scorpions, but as cunning as a wild fox.\" \"One day, he shall slay the overlord of fire and ascend to the oldest of thrones .

They escaped the prying gaze of the Dragonheirs in the dark, walking the glimmering coral stair into the realm of daylight. It is said that at that time, the ocean people would take a single seashell as remembrance for their clan. And as for those who had lost theirs, they would be welcomed into a new family. In the ancient tongue, these pure shells would become known as the Parcels of Reunion. Two parties who embrace shall not again be parted by an outside force, though this enjoining is not itself eternal.

Only the Divine Priestess had the right to sing the great song themed around those pearls. Legend has it that the rainbow-hued clams produced these flawless gems in gratitude for Watatsumi's tenderness. In latter days, it was even said that the bloodline of the Divine Priestess was originally birthed from these pearls. Having stepped down from her soft, vivid cradle, she and the sisters who danced with the sea and moon were greatly favored, For out of his rejoicing and love, Omikami gave unto them beautiful gems that granted them the pure desire to pursue daylight. In the hands of those whose veins run true with Watatsumi blood, pearls seem to gleam brighter than normal. Perhaps this is but an ancient tale, the truth of which can no longer be verified. But it is said that at the point of defeat, the Divine Priestess and the twin sisters exchanged their clothes and concealed themselves within the endless waves. Only this bright pearl was lost in the rippling tumult, returning to the silent solitude of the depths.",
        "Sea-Dyed Blossom": "A tender flower from the ocean. Its core is adorned with pure pearls. The songs of Watatsumi Island say that these flowers bloom in the pearl-lit depths. Steeped in the lovesickness of the diving sea-daughters and the gentle moonlight, they would give off a pearly gleam. When all conflicts have ceased, the sea beasts shall no longer weep for their lonesome companions, And when the moonlight rises over Touzan , the lovely deity shall rise and sing. \"Come, sea-daughters, come and see, O people of my heart, for the moon is out tonight.\" \"Though Touzan might fall this night, the lightning and the storm can never hide the moon's pearly glory...\" The lonesome maiden will sing and dance upon the moon-silver waves. The divers shall forget the pain of loss, and even the tender flowers will regain their vibrance."

Since my level of learning could not compare with the sages, I failed to earn the favor of the previous ruler . So too did I fail to stop them from tearing away the veil of sin, ushering in a tide of divine wrath, destruction, and foolishness... Then I shall become instead a fool, a Fatuus , and devote myself to Her Majesty , who understands my pain... My name is Pierro , The Jester. Please listen to the words I have to say: Proud Fatui comrades, I know your hearts harbor both the fires of rage and the cold of eternal winter. Each one of us has borne witness to the absurd callousness of the foundational principles of this world. So, let us don our masks in mockery of the world as we go forth and rewrite the rules of destiny.",

He was not one of the favored , and could only pursue worldly power. But though money ought to mean nothing to the gods, They held it firmly within their grasp nonetheless, along with the countless other forms of power that they wielded. Perhaps he lusted for money because he had once been destitute, Or perhaps the fact that the gods had never looked upon him with favor ignited a burning desire for resistance inside him... \"The people of the land from which these coins hail revere contracts above all else.\" \"In the name of money, I shall respect the contract between us...\" \" We shall, by whatever means necessary, become the heart that pumps money around the world.\" \"And, when the moment comes, that heart shall cease beating by our will alone.\"",

The reason I followed the trail of smoke and tracked you down is that I wish to strike a deal with you...\" \"Let the flames that now devour you be extinguished by the grace of Her Majesty. What say you?\" The first Fatuus gave power to a young woman in whom the flame of life had all but died, And in her wild imagination, she saw the line that lay between the corrupt past and a stainless future... \"I understand. Then, let glacial ice take the place of my erased past and extinguish these undying flames.\" \"Let the darkness of corruption, the pain of the world, and the humans, beasts, and the sin they carry all be purified by silent ice.\" But despite this, a pure white flame continued to burn within her heart... \"We share the same goal, you, your Tsaritsa , and I.\" \"Cleanse the sources of distortion in this world: short-sighted, ignorant gods and the darkness and corruption of the Abyss .\" \"Good. I will do whatever it takes to become an effective instrument in the advancement of our common cause.\" \"For even if I dress in pure white from head to toe, the ashes of the dead that have long left their stain on every inch of my being can never be cleansed.\"",

Yet, due to an error that cannot be known, he roused himself from slumber , And began to wander the mortal realm. Before the Fatui found him, he had drifted for countless years And in that time, this is what his experience had taught him: \"I am a 'human' who surpasses all others.\" \"Even the gods daren't meddle in my fate.\" \"Neither mortal nor god, nor fate itself, is qualified to be my judge.\" \"I am free to choose how I wish to spend the remainder of my days.\" \"Since these mask-wearing people are so fun to be around...\" \"I think I'll become one of them.\"",

If one were to disassemble a part of this machine and make enhancements to it, Its performance could be greatly amplified. With or without a Vision , and irrespective of their physique or combat skills, \"Enhanced humans\" would surely display strength far beyond the average. Despite the risk of being denounced as a heretic and permanently cast from the circle of the wise, The youth candidly jotted down these thoughts in the margins of his research notes: I. As anticipated, no research breakthroughs are possible, given the working style of the Akademiya. II. Nevertheless, being expelled would be a loss. One needs an environment conducive to research. Following a trail of rumors of heresy, the first of the Fatui tracked him down... \"Merely an enhanced human? If your great nation can furnish me with sufficient resources and ample time, I could even manufacture that which you would call a god . What say you?\" In the desert that shone bright like liquid gold, he inquired of the Snezhnayan diplomat: \"Will you treat me like the Akademiya did? Will you call me a monster, a madman?\" \"Or will you treat me as my hometown did, and chase me away with pitchforks and clubs...?\" However... \"Good. Then, we are now in partnership.\" \"As for the matter of your title \u2014 what do you say to this...\" Taken completely by surprise by the sheer irony of the title he was given, the young man burst into hysterical laughter."

The traveler was the wandering lyrist, and that maiden in the country of wine was a prisoner of the nobility . For reasons he knew not himself, his lyre-song revealed his true heart. \"What would move me, you ask? ...Well, it would be your smile.\" \"I've never known you to smile, after all. Not even once.\" \"I will break the chains that bind you.\" \"When that time comes, would you let me see you smile?\" \"Yes, and thank you.

The wandering traveler had once against lost a place to call home. The condescending evil stole his love's joy, And the endless conflict ground down his irreverent soul. Those gentle, playful rhythms of revelry, Now turned to sharp, icy clangs. For his comrades , for his best friend, for the tables around which none would again share wine. For freedom, for life, and for revenge against the evil that had taken her smile. Thus resolved, the traveler plucked his last string, and fired his final arrow. As he grew accustomed to life in this foreign land , he gazed up at the azure sky. Ah, so the sky here was the same as the one back in his homeland ...",

First came the girl who used a flute as a sword , and then that fellow Kreuzlied \u2014 one by one, the traveler met them all.

Some may label it an imitation, a false life, For life lies in change, pain and growth, In meetings, and also in partings. But the memories of meeting her, Of watching the fireworks bloom in the sky like fresh flowers together, The memories of that foxy-eyed woman who eventually disappeared without a trace... That unwithering flower is the final thing to remember her by. In the end, the difference comes down to the fact that for some, Life is as eternal as this undying summer bloom, But for most, it is as transient as smoke.",
        "Summer Night's Finale": "An intricately-made throwing dart. It is a common sight during the summer festival . In the ghost stories of Inazuma , There is a tale about a meeting between the human and inhuman... To celebrate my wife's pregnancy, I went to the shrine to give a votive offering. But for reasons unknown, I went up the mountain with these objects. The water balloon from when I was seven, the fox mask from when I was seventeen, And a flower that would not wilt in ten or even a hundred years. Why did I expect to meet her again? No matchmaker introduced myself and my wife, and we were always short on money, And it took some time for us to produce an heir, But our days were still filled with happiness, were they not? But still I detoured on that mountain road to the place where I'd seen the fireworks with her. Pulling the bushes apart, I thought I saw her dressed in white, sitting upon that rock. But when I came forward and looked, it was just a fox sunbathing. It leaped up at the sound of snapping branches, and fled into the woods, And like the spots of light that poke between leaves moved by the breeze, it was gone in a flash. All that was left was an old throwing dart.",

People will often take on the guise of the fox of legend, Covering their faces with masks based on her divine visage, Perhaps wishing that they might gain her ability of transformation. In Inazuma's legends, everything has a spirit. ...But even so, It is likely that most such beings would have long fled, Driven into the forests by the suppression of the Shogun . But many people still believe in these divine foxes and the ability to be indwelt by them... They believe that thousands of years of age may confer power upon animals. As such, they also believe in what this fox mask represents. A note has been left on the back of this mask, written in a lovely hand. \"I'm sorry, I departed under the cover of the fireworks.\" \"We will most likely never meet again. Take care of yourself.\"",

In the ghost stories of Inazuma, This has something to do with an encounter with something inhuman... On the night of the summer festival, as I walked the path to the shrine with the girl I admired, I heard, only barely, the sound of a lost child's cries. In that moment of distraction, I fell, spraining my ankle and breaking that pocket watch. While she ran to look for some ointment, I tried to make way for the people passing through, And sat down on a rock by the wayside to rest. The beautiful mask-wearing woman sat down beside me. \"There are few who know about this spot.\" \"But it's the best place to watch the fireworks, you know?\" It should have been a dream. We hadn't met in ten years, And she had aged not a single day in those years, and yet... \"You've grown so much. Looks like we should pass on the game of fusen.\" \"I've brought wine, though. Let's watch the fireworks together. What do you say?\"",

Before we knew it, the tide of people escorting the divine palanquin had washed us apart. I cried by the torii gates along the road to the shrine , And I counted the feet of the people ascending the mountain . I do not know when it happened. But a beautiful lady with fox-like eyes had come to my side, and taken my hand. \"How preposterous, to leave such an adorable child here.\" \"So, how about it? Would you like to see the fireworks, throw some darts, and play fusen with me?\""

    "Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City": {
        "Beast Tamer's Talisman": "This flower, carved from flint and Drakite, was left in Cinder City . It is a talisman passed down through generations by beast tamers from the Scions of the Canopy . A flint paw print adorns the item, said to have been made by the first Yumkasaurus to bond with a human. The beast tamers are those who focus on building friendships with Saurians . Their ideals are sometimes incomprehensible even to their fellow tribespeople, For they seek to settle matters peacefully even with violent Saurians who have hurt a human, even attempting to beat the Saurian Hunters to the punch. \"There is a way to gain the trust of even the most vicious Saurian \u2014 all that is needed is enough patience.\" This was the wisdom the young beast tamer received from his master alongside this weighty talisman, and he kept it in his heart. \"Beasts, too, have the same hearts as we do.\" So he believed, and so kept faith, until the world-engulfing black tide came. Those were monsters who could never be understood, beasts with whom peace could never be made. When he finally returned to his hometown, all he saw were dreams ripped to shreds by monstrous claws running amok. Settling the tribespeople fortunate enough to survive, the beast tamer, no longer young, embarked on a journey from which there could be no return. This time, his foes were the heartless demons that came in with that dark tide, and dealing with them, too, required patience. For only patience could ensure that not one of them was left to plague the land he held dear. Legends hold that the ancient Python King once forged a secret, Abyss -repelling treasure that could only be retrieved from the filth-ridden ancient city. Perhaps such was simply the wishful thinking of those who dwelled deep in despair, but for the brave, this hope was yet worth a try. At the end of his journey, the warrior bereft of his home would reach the burned-out city, and there come face to face with a secret long buried .",
        "Demon-Warrior's Feather Mask": "The tribe built atop the mountains would regularly host combat tournaments, in which contestants would wear special masks. These served to intimidate opponents, but contestants also saw them as symbols for themselves. Whenever a masked warrior took the field, their fans would roar out, yet fall silent when the opposition made their entrance. But when the man wearing the feather mask bearing a falcon's semblance entered, all would be strangely silent. Before becoming an adventurer, Taika was the mightiest warrior in the Flower-Feather Clan, always getting the upper hand during these rites of contention. Sometimes this would even bore him. Perhaps this was how the rest of his life would play out \u2014 for how could he have known of the imminent catastrophe then? It began as mere dark clouds roiling on the horizon, then sporadic reports of people disappearing in the night realm ... and when the monsters appeared before them, None were ready. Nonetheless, someone had to shoulder the responsibility, and the strong naturally should bear a greater burden. It was only after witnessing true war that he first felt the weight of destiny. Thus did he bid his wife and unborn child farewell, and he became himself a fearsome demon on the battlefield, For to vanquish demons and monsters, one must become more ferocious still. That was the last battle of his life, and as he collapsed amidst the pool of blood atop the apex of the Cinder City , countless scenes flashed before his eyes. He glimpsed the fiery red flames of the ancient land bloom before them once more like fields of flowers upon the plains, \"The gates of hell are stained red by the flowing blood of the brave. Let me offer my blood, and leave the key to those gates with my child.\" Or perhaps what he saw was the faint light through the crack in that gate, at the last reminding him of the words he said to his beloved wife as they parted. \"...If it's a girl, call her Bona . She will surely become an outstanding warrior.\"",
        "Mountain Ranger's Marker": "Some say that the Mountain Rangers who came from the spring's source would leave these feather-like tokens on the paths they trod, Both to mark the road out and also to tell future visitors that someone had come this way in the past. Today, these tokens lie silently in deserted nooks of the ash-laden ancient city . And none would ever walk these paths again, just as those who left the tokens behind had hoped. They had stepped on every firm rock in the mountain cliffs and trod upon every fallen leaf in the forest\u2014 Never did they stop, those Mountain Rangers, they who had long committed every inch of Natlan to memory. Whenever travelers or explorers from abroad arrived, they would enthusiastically serve as guides, Though even those wondrous sights to behold were to them merely old childhood friends. Then the day came when the black tide swept across the distant skies, and all that was once familiar vanished into the void. Where children once played laughing in gardens, now only ashes and bones burned by wildfire remained. Where the tribespeople once washed their work fatigue away in hot springs, now fresh blood and mud ran over the banks. But the final Mountain Ranger had no time to stop and mourn, for there were things he had to do\u2014 To set out again on this path he no longer knew, and retake his home, once so familiar. Legends said that a treasure powerful beyond measure lay at the heart of the black tide, in the ancient city wherein a foul dragon lurked. It was akin to a golden wheel that could reverse time's flow, burning away the writhing agonized present and bringing the beautiful past back. As if grasping a last lifeline, the veteran, peril-proven Mountain Ranger decided to make this his final stop, Even should it be yet another trap laid by some heartless spectator for the terrified people.",
        "Mystic's Gold Dial": "Ordinarily speaking, mystics born in the canyon of night smoke would have to train for decades to grasp the techniques needed to communicate with the Wayob . But in this most chaotic of times , even the freshest-faced disciple had to take to the battlefield, guiding the heroic spirits of the fallen home. This lovely golden disc, lost within the ancient city , once belonged to an equally beautiful little mystic, and the needle upon it always points home. When the black tide darkened the sun and enveloped the land, the Night Kingdom was also occupied by the vicious hounds of the beast-rifts , and their dark blood was smeared everywhere. The voices of the ancient Wayob were drowned amidst the sonorous sea of metal and stone clashing and the wailing of tormented life, nigh forgotten by all. But the tribal shamans knew that for warriors devoured by the dark shadows , even death was a luxury, And even should their valiant spirits escape the clutches of evil, they would often lose their way in the night realms , finally becoming unable to return home. To maintain the staying power of the tribes in battle and to reclaim their lost kin, one group of mystics after the next departed the canyon, And they could be seen fighting everywhere, whether it was a corpse-strewn battlefield, or amidst ruins filled with devastation. For the young mystic named Liriwu , this was her first time embarking on such a long and arduous journey. The team of adventurers whose goal was to reach the city above the clouds were battle-hardened veterans one and all, save for her. Although she had been most earnest in her desire to join, the creatures lurking in the city still far exceeded her imagination. Her companions had long anticipated this, and so they left her behind in a safe tower before departing quietly, When the girl who had fled in the face of danger finally made it to their encampment, all that awaited were shattered corpses, the remains of the dragon's hearty meal. As a mystic, not only had she failed to rescue her allies, but she could not bring their souls back , either. But if nothing else, she had to bring tales of their end back to their families who yet awaited their return. \"I remember now... our leader said that he had a child , so... Come on, Liriwu, pull yourself together...\" Carrying new hope in her heart, she set out on another path \u2014 upon a homeward road for all.",
        "Wandering Scholar's Claw Cup": "Even in this fertile land where martial prowess prevails , some have eyes only for books and knowledge. So it was for a certain someone who claimed to be the President of the Saurian Relics Association , who carried thick woven scrolls day in and day out, Or spent those days tampering with mystery mechanisms of unknown provenance. To prove that his research was not utterly useless, He would also make some items, with this strangely shaped beast-claw goblet being his pride and joy. At that time, he had yet to realize how much of a luxury all this pointless study was. When dark nightmares devoured homes , all the woven scrolls they worked so hard to find were destroyed in the fires of war. His daily routine, to which he was long used, evaporated as if he had awakened from a quiet afternoon nap, And destiny pushed him onto another path, and in this he no longer had any choice. He had once read in the oldest scrolls that the ruins left by the ancient dragons contained weapons capable of defending against the demons. So, to prevent his comrades from dying in vain, he put his past research aside, dedicating the rest of his life to a new cause. The machines of the secret source excavated from those abandoned ruins were restructured and modified to aid the warriors. Perhaps it was the knowledge accumulated over the years, or perhaps it was some wise sage 's guiding hand behind the scenes, but the project went incredibly smoothly, Until, at last, in the depths of a forsaken city , he discovered a secret \u2014 or perhaps a curse \u2014 that had been hidden for thousands of years. Legends held that the Python King of Ochkanatlan once built a sky-faring treasure ship , And that within this ship was a secret prize that could drive the Abyss beyond the bounds of the world. Such legends became a balm to those eking out survival in such desolate times, And a beacon to countless adventurers who embarked on lengthy journeys to save the world. Not one who ventured forth returned, making the scholar a target for public scorn, Yet he kept faith that this was no lie, that this was a truth he had witnessed with his very own eyes. Some say he meant to prove his point, or perhaps he meant to end all this, But the traveling scholar, at last, joined a team of adventurers , heading toward the city up in the clouds."

Back then, I was just a young shrine maiden who had just arrived on Narukami from a small fishing village . I was duller than a teapot and had yet to lose the obstinate impulsiveness and curiosity of a child, I was always naively skeptical of the elegant but incomprehensible words of Lady Saiguu . \"Everything in the world is entangled. Hence, illusory visions were born out of concrete reality.\" \"The so-called omamori cannot make one's wishes come true at all, but they can make them eternal through this entanglement.\" Seeing my befuddled expression, a picture of complete confusion, Lady Kitsune couldn't help bursting into laughter, She cheerfully knocked my head with her pipe and sneakily changed the subject. \"I suppose you've met your fated one as well, Hibiki ?\" \"What sort of 'fate' could there be with a rude and reckless brute like that!\" \"Oh, is that so? But darkness engulfed everything in the end. That \"fate,\" too, was no more.",
        "Hopeful Heart": "A special slip cylinder that the shrine uses for fortune-telling, It is supposedly infused with good fortune that the kitsune have imparted upon it. Fortune telling is born from the questions of lost people. Thus, be it good or bad fortune, it will help them navigate their future. In other words, there are only lost people, and no inaccurate fortunes. I've learned a lot while studying at the shrine. Now, even someone as dull-witted as I am has learned how to talk like a mighty kitsune. During this time, even someone as inhuman as the mighty Yougou Tengu has gotten a daughter . Even that leatherhead Konbumaru has also become one of the Shogun 's own Hatamoto , and shall soon marry the daughter of a high-ranking samurai. \"Such a lovely kid. Even the great Yougou Tengu, who used to kill all day for fun, had the mother inside her brought out... just a little.\" \"Still... the shrine is always missing the liveliness of children. That's not good. Say, Hibiki , how would you like to be a kid again?\" The Lady Kitsune's joke was out of line as always, coming forth with the self-serving scent of sakura wine. \"Aw, Hibiki, why the long face? How about this then? I, the Lady Saiguu , shall tell your fortune for you!\" \"Haha, see? See, it's \"Great Fortune.\" \"Great Fortune\"! You know what that means?\" \"It means you took away all the bad fortune slips. Please stop mocking me, Lady Saiguu.\" \"No... it means that the person you're missing will be lucky enough to become a part of your memories forever.\" That's why you have to be strong and must live on for a long, long time. Even if all the people you cherish are gone, as long as you are still alive, The time you spent with them will never perish...",
        "Morning Dew's Moment": "An elegant watch adorned with a shrine bell. The hands always point towards the wee hours of the morning. As the sky brightens, morning dew condenses and then disappears. As beautiful as this colorful scenery may be, it is still short-lived. I once enjoyed the chirping of cicadas and the moonlight with Lady Saiguu on a slope in the middle of an autumn night. Back then, I was just a shrine maiden from the country, young and stubborn. Like a chirping finch, noisily insisting on my own view. A faint smile that crossed the mouth of Lady Kitsune fascinated me, but her words were \u2014 and remain \u2014 incomprehensible: \"Trying to hold on to a moment's beauty is like foolishly trying to grasp the morning dew.\" \"Like the morning dew, I have already passed away. All you have seen of me is but a residual vision, born of your wishes.\" In that vague memory, she kept saying some incomprehensible things. Her expression as sorrowful as the eighth month's moon, and I suddenly... Then she rapped me over the head with her tobacco pipe, wearing her usual expression of rebuke and mockery: \"Hibiki, the sun's about to rise.\" \"We should head back.\"",
        "Shaft of Remembrance": "A demon-slaying arrow used by the shrine for prayers and to drive away catastrophes, It is said to be capable of pursuing and destroying all demons. People often say that demon-slaying arrows can drive away evil, but evil is never an objective thing. Evil often stems from within our hearts, born out of delirious minds that have turned cold and ashen from terror. Lady Saiguu has been gone for a long time now, and I am no longer that young shrine maiden training at the Grand Narukami Shrine . Whenever I hold that empty smoking pipe, I can feel that emptiness and dull pain hover over me like a phantom. Having someone worth missing, losing someone whom I cannot help missing... And time keeps moving like a spinning wheel. Silent and tranquil, the Lady Kitsune's white form hidden in the deep darkness left a deep impression in the shrine maiden's dreams. The Great Tengu went into self-imposed exile , enraged at her own incompetence as the Lady Saiguu's protector, leaving Teruyo behind. Harunosuke left for another country amid the fury of his mourning, while Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to clear the Mikoshi name . As for the man who taught me archery in the sacred forest and patiently listened to my na\u00efve promise under the scarlet sakura boughs, He will eventually return to me, even if he were to be blinded by splattered blood, or turned into a fierce beast by that dark defilement... I shall save him with our bow and arrows, to keep our promise, which ever veers towards breaking. I shall destroy evil with our bow and arrows, exorcising folly and needless obsession. \"Come see me, you idiotic problem gambler.\" \"And don't lose your way this time, Konbumaru.\" Still, who won the last throw of the dice... She touched the bow lightly while pondering such unimportant things."

    "Silken Moon's Serenade": {
        "Crystal Tear of the Wanderer": "That was a time when the gentle frost-light still lingered, a silver mirror unbroken, even as the golden realm had already fallen. In a single night, the glorious golden tower fell like a fig tree. Across the frozen northern plain, From the holy citadel to the ancient capital, dark blue crystal nails annihilated every last city with even the most minuscule sign of life. The once-praised apostle and the gods ' first messenger both vanished in the catastrophe. Those who survived by grace of being nowhere near the cities at the time could only cling to life amidst the freezing wind and snow. With no refuge left to them, they simply waited for destruction to find them in the hollow dark. This is the great extinction spoken of in later prayers. Halcyon prosperity turned to dust, And the gods remained silent, unmoved by cries, curses, or reproach. In the despair of that long night, only one celestial ruler shed tears for the mortals' pain. She was the mistress of the Frost Moon , queen of the celestial chariot and of light, a heavenly agent whose origin was one with that of the world. Moved by pity, and a deeper, unspoken wish, she heeded the survivors' prayers. According to legend, she spun gleaming threads from the silver glow to lead the displaced across the frozen plains. And where her tears, full of longing, fell upon the frost-covered soil of the far north, they blossomed into lilies that would stand eternal in the icy winds. The proud descendants of Hyperborea call themselves the \" Frostmoon Scions \" for this reason, To honor the divinity who, whatever her original intent, gave them a new lease on life.",
        "Frost Devotee's Delirium": "That was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise. It was then that the great plan, carried through countless generations since the time of extinction, was on the verge of culmination. The bloodline, purified for over a thousand years, would at last give birth to the chosen one destined to reign over Elysium. The false sevenfold radiance of the high heavens would fall at her feet, and the bones of the earth would rise to follow her. For from her would spring union with the world, and from her would the first great cause be rebuilt. That was the sacrosanct duty that had been passed down to the daughters of the far north. So it should have been. So it should have been... But on a moonless, snowbound night, the girl chosen to bear the sacred heir met the boy from the northern realm , And in his eyes, as clear as a winter's day, she beheld a reflection of a self she had never known. This unfamiliar stirring was enough to make the holy woman turn her back on destiny for that young officer from afar. For this new feeling, this foolishness called love, she cut off her bloodstained antler-crown and cast it down upon the snowy earth. The fallen one, who had betrayed her own people, ultimately failed to fulfill her destined duty. She was captured by a spy sent by the mad monk and was soon to be returned to the homeland she was meant to love. But as she looked down at the officer by her feet, crimson pooling beneath him, she drew the dagger to her throat in one final, fatal kiss. And so, the woman who failed to bear the sacred heir was buried in haste, her death forestalling the prophecy. Fortunately, the leaders of every generation had long prepared for premature end of such a blessed lady. Lovia , the then-Archpriestess, swiftly turned to a lesser branch of the bloodline for spares. But the twin sisters born of this lineage were a pale shadow of the one they were meant to replace. Hundreds of years might now have to pass before another child of sufficient purity was born. Seeing the glory of the great endeavor slip from her grasp like dissipating dew, The antler-crowned Archpriestess, maddened by anguish and obsession, hatched a terrible scheme. Why wait for the thousand winds to sweep through several generations? If they were too impure, Their flesh and blood too weak to bear the radiance of true moonlight... Did the Frost Moon 's boon not linger faintly in all \u2588\u2588\u2588? Then let \u2588\u2588\u2588 purify their \u2588\u2588\u2588! Thus, in the name of flawless moonlight, the priestess committed an act so profane, That even the mistress of the Frost Moon would recoil in horror at the blasphemy...",
        "Holy Crown of the Believer": "That was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise. The gods' ancient blessing, like a lone spark on the vast tundra, eventually flickered out. As the heavenly moon passed from the sky, the earth that could not become the moon began to wither. The great deeds miracle workers did in years past had faded into vaporous prayers, and those prayers were now the silent worries of the masses. In those crumbling, moonless nights, even a holy woman of the purest blood, Was hard-pressed to weave the flowing light into a song that could move the world, as her ancestors once did. No matter how fervently the ancestors of the far north once vowed to follow their departed gods, Their descendants , mortals in this sublunary sphere, lived lives as fleeting as a flickering flame. In days long gone, when one could still behold holy women and Archpriestesses channeling the grace of the gods, People yet believed the new moon would one day arise from the shattered light. And so, when the last glimmer of grace had faded and miracles were no longer witnessed, The line between so-called faith and so-called lies in turn grew as thin and fragile as the morning mist. Legend has it that the antler crown of Moonchanters today was a gift from the Frost Moon at the moment of its obliteration. The silver tree was splintered, and bereft of white branches they might find, the priesthood pleaded for new coronals. Out of pity, the mistress of the moon wove holy crowns for them out of flawless moonlight, ones innate to their birth. That was why the last Archpriestess chose to forge her circlet from cold, pure iron. The young Lovia was just a priestess then, one who had never once witnessed a moonlit blessing, And she dreamed that such lies, that deceived others and oneself alike, could still bind the unfaithful believers together. Decades later, when the false antlered crown sank into the foul, corrupt blood, That which reflected in her eyes was still not the flawless moonlight, but the frigid night swallowed whole by her own shadow.",
        "Joyous Glory of the Pure": "That was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise. The descendants of the far north could no longer hear the divine teachings of the high heavens, and they were consumed by burning wrath, just like in the days of old. No one knew how to forge anew the marvel the apostle of the Golden City had revealed to their ancestors. Yet the ambitions of the exiled \u2014 the ambitions of mortals \u2014 were more unyielding than even those of the gods. Should one lose the reliquary that can overnight till ten thousand acres of fertile land upon the dark, misty sea of ice, Then pen wild oxen into the furrows so that one may conquer the tundra inch by inch with fire, hoe, and sickle. Should one lose the arrow that can strike down the gods and pierce even that false sky, Then forge the plowshare into sword and blade, and the sickle and hoe into spear and halberd, then let blood be the lantern that dispels the darkness. And should the authority of creation, gifted by the highest of angels , be broken, Then one must govern the proliferation of the countless generations that follow by the crudest, primordial means remaining, that is, through law. So it must remain, until blood thinned by disaster and exile is purified into holy seed, And mortal descendants are born as perfect beings, fully one with the world. The perseverance and determination of all living creatures would eventually overcome all calamity \u2014 or at least that is what they firmly believed. After all, those who have planned the future of their people rarely have to suffer the slings and arrows of their contempt. \"Here, drink this pure moonlight, my beloved child, my most cherished child!\" \"Let it weave into your flesh and blood, so that you too may be worthy of the gods' grace.\" \"Look to the apostle of the Golden City. How he drank bitter wine and fought for the freedom of his compatriots!\" \"Like him, you must embrace this joyous pain, for from it, perfection will one day be born.\" The two could no longer tell what filled the ancient silver goblet. But if the kindly grandmother said so, then it must also be the will of the gods. Yes, yes. All to sculpting perfection, to fulfill a wish that had endured a thousand years. For the sake of the prophesied Elysium and the king destined to descend upon the world, impurity and trial had first to be transcended...",
        "Pristine Plume of the Blessed": "That was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise. This is the story of two sisters who, born defective products, were never meant to be blessed. In the moonlight, an undisturbed sanctuary for strangers, the fragile souls shared a single breath. In the brief moments between agonies, moments that should have been filled with joy, they huddled together, drawing what little warmth they could from each another. They had never seen their parents, and nor had they ever heard the wind whispering through the groves. The two of them had only their grandmother , and the only way they'd seen the world was through the pages of a faded storybook. Its brittle, yellowed pages, torn and tattered, revealed to them a world they'd never seen: There it was, a single white bird, a streak of grace, gliding beneath a perfect moon. As they admired the free creatures of the fairy tales, the two children made a promise to each other... One day, the two of them would fly together like the white birds in the vast sky. \"Since the day we were born, it's always been just the two of us.\" \"When the day comes for us to leave, let's live the rest of our lives together.\" Many years later, one of them broke their promise, leaving for a faraway place alone. But alas, this was no flight toward a brighter future, but a fall into a much darker night. With her went half the dream, and half the pain meant for them both. Aila , later to become the first Moonchanter, began to endure twice the torment from that day on. \"So you lied to me all along as well... My older sister, the only one I ever truly trusted.\" \"But I won't resent you... I have long lost hope for the sky beyond.\""

    "Song of Days Past": {
        "Echoing Sound From Days Past": "In the long years before the Many Waters converged, the tribes of the people of bygone times had the tradition of tolling bells. The bells once tolled for sunrise, for sunset, for births, and for deaths, And in the end, at the final moment of the golden blanket that covered the dome of the sky, the bells tolled for destruction. The tireless iron legions completely erased the name tribes now long forgotten from the map, But never once considered that the prosperous empire itself would meet the same fate just a few short decades later. The golden palace turned to rubble in a night, the noble music collapsed by ambition and betrayal, The sorrowful wish of the God-King thus ended, yet the echoes of the golden melody still reverberated in mortal hearts: Some wallowed in the glory of the past, and sought to play the music once more at any cost, Some abandoned their old names of their own accord, and hunted the ghosts lurking in the forests for a peaceful tomorrow, Some kept only their previous names and hid them in song along with the hazy legends of the past... \"A sacred vessel that can grant any wish... Heh, even if that Oceanid messenger actually said that, it sounds pretty preposterous\" \"Nobody can wash away their sins, just like you can't wash blood out of water. Even if it's completely forgotten, sin is still sin\" \"None can revive the past, just like none can retrieve the light of day. The past is dead, and even I know that\" \"...\" \"But if such artifacts do exist in this ridiculous world, if this one really can grant all wishes\" \"If all the tears of the future really could be wiped away, and the heirs of the high sea would never again need suffer the pain and sorrow of the past\" \"Then let me drown in such fantastical delusions one last time\" The wailing and weeping that had whirled in her ears for decades, those phantoms of the past, Those who died for her, those who died because of her, none of that was important any longer, Before she took that step alone into the valley, it was as though she heard that sound ringing from the past once more\u2014 the tolling of the night bell... Though the twilight sun is clear to all, some will always see it as the light of dawn.",
        "Forgotten Oath of Days Past": "In the long years before the Many Waters converged, the golden authority inundated all like a roiling tide, and where the iron legion went, the barbarians surrendered wholly. The glorious world plated in gold was like a day without end, and just as the Harmosts steadfastly believed, the defeated people of bygone times submitted to the symphony of the new order... That is how it should have been. But that order which represents civilization, a rapturous melody unmatched by mortals, was halted in the savage north, The previously fractious tribes had united under the command of Aremorica's heir, and the fires of rebellion broke out across the empire's fragile borders... This was the one later eulogized as \"Lochknight\" : Opposing the omnipresent golden authority with a weak body of flesh and bone. The songstress who ruled over many tribes never considered herself a sovereign. Instead, she proclaimed herself an oracle who could hear the Queen of All Waters . In distant Capitolium, the sages turned up their noses at such absurdity, as though they were little more than the delirious ravings of children, Yet still her army swept through the warring tribes like a storm, convincing their fellow tribesmen at swordpoint to pledge themselves to the Queen of All Waters. Though the poems and plays of later generations have many versions of the Knight's pledge, there are two vows that run through every version like an indispensable thread: First, never draw your sword against those who pledge faith in Egeria . Second, never compromise in the face of evil (also written as: Do not tolerate even a trace of filth). \"We swear by the ever-blooming silver flower, that we will drive the golden usurper from the high sea , and wash away injustice with blood and tears\" \"We swear to protect the spirits arisen from pure water , to protect the blessings left behind by the Queen of All Waters, until the pure spring flows as before\" And thus did endless war spread like a plague, burning proud gold and untarnished silver alike. In the end, the Harmost's desire to end the conflict tragically turned into little more than a passing mirage, and furious vengeance like roaring waves surged towards an irreversible outcome. Until the light of salvation finally rose over the distant horizon, though it would never be reflected in the eyes of those who sought redemption...",
        "Poetry of Days Past": "In the years when the Many Waters converged, the gentle mistress crossed the ruins of ages past and built a new city. The long night had passed and dawn was breaking: The past had become a shadow of a dream, dissolving with the darkness of the night. This was the true Golden Age. No more Usurpers obsessed with power, no more barbarians indulging in vengeance, The glorious symphony would never sound again, only odes to love and verses of justice, blown by the morning breeze to the four corners of the high sea... Such subject matter easily endures the tides of time, and even today, more than a thousand years hence, the people still ardently enjoy them, Such as the adventures of the Lochknights, told and retold by generations of poets and playwrights, tales long since known to all and sundry. It is said that they swore by silver armor to fight alongside the Oceanids, to protect the yet untainted pure dews, It is said that they travailed through uncounted trials and tribulations before finally finding the legendary Pure Grail, welcoming the return of the Queen of Many Waters... \"The court that gathered great and glorious heroes, knights bathed in the blood of dragons\" \"The mage and noble maiden trapped in tower tall, the journey to seek the sacred vessel\" Feasts and vows, sorrow and farewells, many scenes that exist only in the fantasies of elegant verse, all unveiled before the eyes of \"Erinnyes.\" However, that hero who shared her name had nothing to do with her, and the ballads sung of that supposed past are nothing more than dreams of the present.",
        "Promised Dream of Days Past": "In the long years before the Many Waters converged, legends of the Pure Grail circulated amongst the tribes of the people of bygone times. Yet from time immemorial, none has yet laid eyes on the Grail itself. The sole evidence that this \"Golden Grail Brimming with Primordial Water\" is more than a mere fantasy born of human imagination, Are a few scattered words echoing throughout the ages from ancient Oceanids . Legends say that sacred vessel can cure even the most terrifying of wounds, restore youth, and revive the dead, And that only the purest of people can behold its glory, obtaining eternal life and wisdom unending. But as spake the ancient sages: Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change. The curtain may fall abruptly on the once most splendrous of songs in but a single night. The cries of countless self-proclaimed civilized citizens sank into the endless waves along with the golden city bearing the name of eternity. But as spake the ancient sages: Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change. The vow of vengeance, once sworn, may be torn asunder in a single night. The songstress who swore to wash away her foes in a tide of blood and tears awoke from her familiar nightmare, only to see naught but raging waves spanning the horizon, even unto the far shore... \"O sons of the high sea, stained with original sin, we brother and sisters who have drunk deep from the well of suffering\" \"You know well the fearful fate foretold, you have seen the cataclysm that will eventually come\" \"Harden your heartstrings, and do not fear, nor be you dismayed\" \"You need only seek out the primordial water, seek out the primordial chalice that grants every prayer\" \"You need only speak your wish to her , and all sins shall be forgiven\" Thus, for the Oceanid's pledge, the songstress embarked on the road to seek the Pure Grail, Thus, the heterodoxy that \"the Pure Grail can grant any wish\" began to spread far and wide among the people, 'Twas not until twilight's end that she finally realized, just what that \"primordial chalice\" actually was...",
        "Recollection of Days Past": "Even in the long years before the Many Waters converged, in a tribe as short-lived as the waving seagrass, a gentle evening breeze once caressed the lingering moonlight. A youth , yet ignorant of the laws of the God-King and the path laid by the heavens beyond his ken, adorned her ear with a butterfly wing. In the traditions of the people of bygone times, the dancing butterflies were guides of souls, representing the vow and promise to not part until death. Then, the warrior who had yet to become a musician deeply believed that the days to come were as innumerable as the countless yesterdays, like a whirling dance balanced on this single moment... Yet the currents of fate swept inexorably towards pain and suffering, and the ephemeral wishes of days past perished amidst the cries of blood and flame. When their paths next crossed, it would be in the faraway city, and the disparate tribes that once warred had all been united. The young musician came disguised as a wandering traveler, and in the tournament defeated countless heroes of great renown whose praises would be sung for generations, And at last, he was granted an audience along with the King as champion newly crowned. Ideals of harmony and glory were expounded upon, meaning to extinguish forever the fires of war and burning desire for vengeance. Even the wisest of musicians never anticipated that the moment his identity was revealed, all that would greet him were blades shining like lakelight. As the artificial body was cut to ribbons and his consciousness was about to return, the last thing the musician heard was her whispering as she took him into her arms... \"...\u2589\u2589\u2589\u2589, my \u2589\u2589\u2589\u2589... You need no longer force yourself to speak that which you do not wish\" \"I know that it is the accursed Usurper who has profaned your soul, and imprisoned you in stone\" \"Worry not, my \u2589\u2589\u2589\u2589... I have never forgotten the oath we took then, not for a moment\" \"No matter what price I must pay, I will save you from those freezing fetters, your eternal chains\" \"And when we finally enjoy the embrace of the Queen of All Waters once more, we shall take leave of trouble and sorrow\" \"When this pale butterfly takes flight and dances once more, it shall guide our souls to the far shore of the Many Waters\""

    "Tenacity of the Millelith": {
        "Ceremonial War-Plume": "As a mark of military service, the Millelith use the feathers of high-altitude birds of prey to adorn their uniforms. These tail feathers are only worn on ceremonial occasions. They boost the morale of the citizenry and fill visiting outlanders with a sense of awe. It is said that in its inception, this ceremonial custom was inspired by the nameless yaksha . In the heat of battle, when the yaksha was engaged in fierce combat with the Abyss, some of its plumage was stripped away. The feathers that fell to the ground were seen as a symbol of hope. In the end, the brave yaksha and fearless citizenry would sink into an exhausted slumber in the dark lair of the enemy . Rex Lapis was moved by their sacrifice and observed a prolonged vow of silence among the low murmuring of the mountain stone. The people claim that the nameless yaksha that defended The Chasm was not, in fact, under the command of Rex Lapis. Instead, they believe that it was an act of redemption from a longstanding sin... a price paid for cowardice and dereliction of duty. Whatever the truth of the matter, the yaksha that had once soared through celestial heights had now returned to a free existence amongst the clouds. As for the soldiers, trapped in eternal slumber in the depths of The Chasm... their legend continues to evolve with the flow of time.",
        "Flower of Accolades": "In an age when solemn songs were sung from the clifftops, a meteorite once fell into the Chasm . Out of the depths of the boundless night sky above, the iron meteorite plummeted to the ground, turning the earth to Glazed Sand Crystal on impact. Though human life is fleeting, Rex Lapis personally ordered the Millelith to rush to the defense of the mines. As the Abyss flooded forth, the Millelith escorted countless civilians to safety. Miners tell tales of a small number of troops from the rearguard, who remained in the Chasm. Together with the nameless yaksha , they fought courageously until they, too, made the ultimate sacrifice among the jagged rocks. In time, the names of both mortals and adepti alike were forgotten. In time, even the mountains and rivers change form. Yet there will never come a time for their honorable deeds to be forgotten. Like this gold-leafed flower, they will shine on forever. 500 years on, the harbor city remains as steadfastly peaceful today as the day the disaster was quelled. And still, the troops wear this golden flower with pride, in honor of the sacrifice made by their forebears.",
        "General's Ancient Helm": "The commander who fought together with the nameless yaksha fell in the line of duty, As did the handful of his compatriots who fought alongside him. To ensure that the afflicted civilians could safely escape, and to maintain their honor in the eyes of the Lord of Geo, The helmet-clad troops of the front line took the lead, pointing their spears towards the Abyss and charging into battle. Disaster arrived in the land of glaze, and a horde of ancient foes came surging forth. At the order of Rex Lapis , the yaksha fought a bloody battle against the warped creations of the Abyss. The fight went on until the last drop of blood had soaked into the battlefield and all that was impure had been cleansed. As the tide of the Abyss receded, the glaze sands shone gloriously once more. But when the gloom that had filled the skies above The Chasm had finally dissipated, the yaksha disappeared without a trace. As for the general and his men who left their helmets on the battlefield, they rest there in peace forevermore.",
        "Noble's Pledging Vessel": "When the Millelith was first founded, Liyue was still a savage and dangerous place. The elders of towns, villages, and tribes would pledge oaths of allegiance with a golden cup. As a show of loyalty to Rex Lapis and duty to their countrymen, They selected valiant soldiers from all regions. These soldiers became known as the Millelith . They would go on to take up arms with a yaksha in battle, fighting from the rearguard. They too drank from that golden cup. It was a final toast to the benevolent and majestic Lord of Geo. With their gaze fixed ahead of them, they stormed into the abyss. Hundreds of years later, a conceited adventurer retrieved the cup from the depths of The Chasm and washed away the imperfections. Miraculously, the cup remained whole and untarnished by the passage of time. The pitch-dark of that subterranean realm had failed to remove its radiance. Yet more centuries passed. Eventually, the people of Liyue would tell tales of an era of catastrophe and a nameless yaksha, Tales of how heroes from disparate heritages and different lands united under a single banner against the Abyss... Inevitably, the tale would touch upon the cup, and how the blood of those that went before remained clear and spotless as the day it was spilled.",
        "Orichalceous Time-Dial": "A hardy timepiece powered by sunlight and moonlight, capable of capturing rays of light even on the darkest of days. When Liyue was threatened by a pitch-black malice, this time-dial helped the soldiers to remember the warmth of the sun. In the course of fighting side by side with the yaksha , these mortal soldiers could not escape being contaminated by karma, or harmed during the slaughtering. To avoid being consumed by the darkness of constant killing, the Millelith soldiers used this timepiece to silently mark the passage of time during each battle. They fixed a unified marching pace and schedule so that one squadron of mortal soldiers would take the battlefield as the one before them retreated. This cycle of advance and retreat continued all the way to the depths of the Chasm , where yaksha and valiant soldiers both fell. 100 years later, this timepiece was unearthed by a miner. Its bronze surface sparkled in the bright starlight. Urban legends tell of a collector of curios wearing black robes , who roamed the market streets one day, buying up Orichalceous Time-Dials and paying a generous sum for each one. Some sellers queried him, curious to know what his reasons were, but he deftly deflected all their questions with an array of excuses and other verbal tricks. As for what this individual's true motive was, perhaps only the unyielding forward march of time can finally deliver a satisfying explanation."

The passage of time is just like lightning. It bursts through the sky and is gone in a flash. Even the Thundersoother could not conquer the flash of time. Within this hourglass, even thunder and lightning have to obey the never-changing law of time. In the hourglass, the shards shatter and merge countless times while time silently flashes by.

The purple insignia shimmered with light under the gaze of enemies. On this small object lightning glittered, as if to foreshadow the downfall of the Beast of Thunder.

    "Unfinished Reverie": {
        "Crownless Crown": "Someone once granted her desire, agreeing to remake the long-dulled feather accessories once the ancient kingdom had fallen. And so she too promised that person, who had long earned her respect, that when the time came, she would give them a turquoise crown in return. It was after witnessing the crooked corpse agonizingly hunched beneath the black beast 's butcher's blade that she understood, The crown she had forged and adorned with her own two hands would wait alone for its master, who would never attend the coronation. Many years later, the odd preferences of that aged mistress of the mines spread about the six tribes . It is said the old lady enjoyed all kinds of luxurious jewelry, much of which could no longer be made with the artistry of contemporary craftsmen. Among these, should it be a work signed by a specific artisan , and should one be willing to present it to her, She would exchange for it at any price in precious gems. Even if it were a forgery, she would take it all the same. When the people of the tribe urged her to, at the very least, not reward the greed of frauds, She said, \"Ah, but I do this precisely because such crude forgeries cannot be allowed to stain his good name!\" Moreover, though she did not advertise the fact, she never truly let such base cheats get away with their perfidy. In contrast to the friends who had courageously sacrificed themselves, her life seemed too long by far. And so, She used the time left to her to gather all that was left behind by the heroes she missed. The scarlet-eyed youth she had loved had returned to the sacred flames after completing his calling, leaving nothing but a warm afterglow. And when the silent hero fell into the ruler's flames , the new world reflected in his remaining eye was already his greatest reward. One of the hero twins was once an incorrigible chatterbox, yet upon witnessing his brother die at the hands of their adversary, his tormented wails wracked his throat hoarse. \"And yet Atawallpa, too, died before me... Who could have imagined that I, the frailest of us, would have lived to the end? The wise amongst the tribes often say that those who have been tossed about by the winds and waves will grow tired of the steady ground, and I am no exception. These years without all of you here... have truly been too dull.\" But there will surely come a time for a reunion with friends long-since passed, and when long-awaited premonition comes to pass. She picked the genuine articles that the craftsman had made from among her jewels \u2014 compared with the forgeries, they were all too few, And with those things bearing his name, she walked into the dark night, never to return. According to legend, on the next day, the people stood under the tree where she had placed the turquoise crown, And they swore an oath to follow her final orders, blotting from history the name of the masterful craftsman she took away with her.",
        "Dark Fruit of Bright Flowers": "It was the age when the banners of the tribes had been coated in dust, gradually losing their color. And before the throne stands a half-man holding a cracked ring, playing with preeminence. Strict orders were given that none should ever again give ear to the instructions left by the deep messengers of twilight , the distant ancestors , and the first ascended \u2014 To hear them not from the mud-caked roots of trees, the flickering flames of bonfires, or the reflections found in the deep woods. And so, the ancient gloom, the moment that engulfs a million darknesses, came at last, Just as the stench of iron lingers even as bloodstains upon the ancient scrolls fade. And so, when the pitch-black darkness thick enough to touch seized the depths , The red-eyed youth , through countless calamities, returned from the kingdom where water flowed as rays of light to the hilly heights of the ineffable city . As he stepped into the floating garden , the raspy warning of the blind, stooped old woman still clutched at his ear: \"As radiant flowers still blossom amongst the clinging vines of distant marsh, Go seek, for here is the land of death, piled high with the skulls of behemoths \u2014 Go seek those the truly righteous, who are still willing to stand in the cold, cruel night, to throw themselves onto the fire, And remember \u2014 never betray their passion, their hatred, their greed, and their ambition! Do not break faith with the eyes of those still willing to gaze upon the burning flames.\" The first to arrive was a young girl , holding a dulled feather accessory. She sought out information for the youth like a quetzal, flitting between the tall tents. The second were the hero twins, the elder whose lips and teeth were sharper than any blade, and the younger whose back bore the brunt of the tyrant's lash. Upon hearing of how the scarlet-eyed youth had saved the Saurians , the taciturn warrior too was willing to contribute his strength. \"But we need someone who understands the layout of this city better than anyone, Who can point out the paths in passages open and secret, and manipulate mechanisms as one might do to toys in the palm of their hand.\" After the scarlet-eyed youth had spoken thus, the usually reticent and reserved hero, That powerful hero who hoped Saurians and humans would live together in peace, remembered the rumor and spoke the name of a craftsman .",
        "Faded Emerald Tail": "\"Whosoever lays eyes upon the turquoise-adorned carvings shall have their minds and souls seized by the ingenuity of their design, Whosoever lays eyes upon the intricate golden inscriptions shall be profoundly moved by the artist 's outstanding craftsmanship.\" The young girl obeyed the commands of the youth to whom she was deeply bonded, seeking out traces of the renowned craftsman among the rumors that flew about in the streets. Yet she found nothing amidst the palatial courtyards and the feasts of the nobility. Thoroughly vexed by this, she took out the ornamental golden feather, and stared into the dim light, recalling the face of her late father. To the side, a drunkard with half his face hidden behind his cowl opened his mouth coldly, recounting the origin of the patterns adorning the feather. Who would have thought the maker of such beautiful accessories would be a beggar of horrifying visage, loitering about a dilapidated tavern? The scars of having been burnt by a raging blaze marred the half of his face that was hidden under a hat, the flesh a melted slurry of blood. But the girl felt no fear, and after recovering from her surprise, she handed the accessory to him. On that night, his eyes upon the ornament whose light had long faded, he told her of things long lost in that land, The story of the emerald-colored quetzal with a long tail, of the time when he had been tasked with making something for one respected by all... \"That was my father, but he was condemned for protecting the tribe 's Saurians , and his life was taken from him.\" The girl's voice was cold. The craftsman saw the same hatred he nursed burning within her eyes. \"Then I shall gladly serve you...r lord,\" he said, before she had even spoken of her purpose. In his heart, he was actually willing to serve her, but that was not something he needed to say. For he could see that at this time, someone else already occupied the girl's heart.",
        "Moment of Attainment": "One of the things that bedevils researchers who study relics is how, Among the many sundials recovered from the ancient ash-covered ruins of the city, They would, for some reason, find an engraving made in exactly the same spot by a burin. Those who came from the canyons believed it was a time for those who had broken with their faith to light the obsidian pillars once more. That day, the one acting on behalf of the leaders of the tribes , the daughter of the mines, Sakkuk , sent the wandering spirits back to the realm of the night . Those who came from the hanging trees believed it was a time for those who had forsaken their contract to sign it once more with the Saurians of the six tribes. That day, the great hero trusted by all warriors, the taciturn Yupanqui , used his sword to shatter the shackles binding the Saurian's neck. Those who came from the spring's source believed it was a time for those who had forgotten their past to listen anew to the echoes of the waves. That day, the elder of the twin heroes, the eloquent Atawallpa , rekindled the desire of all for past glories. Those who came from the fertile lands believed it was a time for the oppressed to rise from the earth once more. On that day, the younger of the twin heroes, the champion Waskar , stood first against the torrent of darkness. Those who came from the mountain peaks believed it was a time for those who had been caged to return to freedom's nest once more. That day, the scarlet-eyed hero summoned the god 's fiery wrath, burnt the corroded city to ash, and restored the tribe to its own. Only the one present who came from the mysterious smoke , the youth who knew the hidden secrets, remained silent. Alone, the image painted on the blanched scroll came to mind. It is said that was a time when a black shadow shrouded the sun. The heroes who had long prepared for this moment seized the opportunity to overthrow the insane king before the empty throne. In the non-mainstream, unofficial histories, the man behind the plan was a skilled artisan who left no name behind. \"But the artisan left behind not a single word in the war that returned authority to the tribes And afterward, he disappeared without a trace from the old stories, covered by layer upon narrative layer.\" The youth smoothed over the nearly identical scratches on the sundials with his hand. Imagining a time, unnumbered sunsets before, after the date to execute the plan had been agreed upon, those hands that might not ever have existed, And the moment the owner of those hands had engraved those marks upon the sundials.",
        "The Wine-Flask Over Which the Plan Was Hatched": "He spoke to the scarlet-eyed young man and his heroes of the trials and tribulations he had endured. It is said the king of the ineffable city once gathered skilled artisans from the tribes , Underground, he excavated gargantuan beastly constructs, whose wings once caught the winds as great banners might, all to fulfill his ambitions. But the king's erratic behavior had long been common knowledge, and so, on the day he finally probed the depths of the secrets , He lit a great fire, intending to burn it all and all who knew of it, burying all together with the ruins, behind the stone gate... Amidst the all-consuming inferno, as a doomed craftsman lay dazed at death's door, A golden tear dripping from the stone head fell into his eye, and he saw much. He spoke of the gigantic creations he saw in his stupor, of elaborate machines whirring. He spoke of shadows driven by the flowing flames, climbing from the distant horizon up to the disk of the moon hanging in the sky. \"So, that golden tear is...\" \"The source of your fountain of fanciful stories?\" So the twin heroes , who had taken in the story as but a tale, asked as they giggled. He could hear the incredulous jocularity in their tone, and they were always like this. The man had long grown accustomed to it. As he felt the young girl 's inquisitive gaze reach him, he forced a derisive laugh, causing the muscles in half his face to sting slightly. In truth, he had seen far more in those flames that had nearly rendered his life as ash, such as flowing golden patterns , Another path to escape from the ruins, as well as the manifold iron rules that had established the empire that stretched far and wide. But the latter might be too far beyond the ken of the youths... He set aside his wine vessel, which had but a few drops sloshing about the bottom left. Perhaps, when the dust finally settled, and when the ancient cornerstone was restored, When all had progressed farther, he could reveal everything, and this pleased him, For at this time, his wildest fantasies already revolved around how to craft a brilliant imperial wall for the new king ."

In the end, these are all pointless things, void of meaning.\" These dark murmurings shook the hearts of those who would never make a name for themselves. But the battle was over in the end, and many a soldier would rest eternally in the cavernous depths. The freakish cries of the dark forces were also silenced like fading ripples... And though mortal spans are short, the land will forever remember.",
        "Flowering Life": "Even the ancient cinnabar cliffs were once home to lovely blooming flowers. Even in the era when blackened blood flowed freely, they were not stained by even the smallest smidge of mud. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Even should the enemy be dark demons, this would not change. The silent mountain people and the steel moon constructed their peaceful camp. \"Oh daughter of the cliffs of Glazed Sand Crystal, weep not for me.\" \"I was born in the shade of Tianheng , and I fight to repay Rex Lapis ' mercy.\" \"I entrust my life to the four-armed Yaksha , and we shall go into the glowing depths.\" \"The shadowed road of the darkest pits we shall tread, we shall brave the stony crystal halls.\" \"We will face the defilement arising from the depths, the twisted beasts that dwell there.\" \"These horrors and their strangeness shall not put me to flight or fear.\" The night wind interrupted the Millelith soldier's words, causing him to be unable to finish what he had to say. He simply left this small flower for that young daughter of the mountain tribe as a memento, a ward against forgetting. \"The only thing I truly fear is to be lost and forgotten.\" \"Should ill fate dictate that I am to be buried in some nameless place, do not forget me.\"",

The mountain miners and the metropolitan merchants still tell the legend of a Yaksha ... People say that the lone traveler with four arms once came to the barren wastes where the star fell. Hearing that this wandering figure's evil-exorcising travels had now brought them hence, the tribes-people of the mountains came forward one after another: \"Guest from afar, please accept our wine, and hear our plea.\" \"You may consider our aged spirits bitter and hard to swallow, a far cry from the sweet brews of Mt. Tianheng that even Rex Lapis praises.\" \"But the heavens have graced us with stores of precious stones and marvelous jade, and we carve the jagged rock for a living.\" \"Thanks to the grace of Rex Lapis, our lives are, while not ideal, at least free of terror.\" \"Yet things have changed, and a dark shadow is cast over the blessing we have received from the fallen star.\" \"We do not have any precious gifts to present as a pledge, but still we beg for your succor.\" The guest heard the elders' plea, and silently drank every drop of that bitter wine. The guest promised nothing, and did not chastise the mortals for their insolence, but simply turned east, disregarding all attempts to make them stay. As for what came after, all now know what happened... But the simple crystal-sand wine cup that the guest shared with the tribal elders remains to this day as a testament to their pact.",

The mountain people, taking it for a sign, repaired the device, allowing it to shine through the darkness again. And though it was returned to its constant westward cycle, a single piece would forever remain behind.\nWhen they moved to the city, they would grind that fragment into crystals and sell it to someone who knew its value... \"Hey, hey, that's a joke, right? I mean, you can't trust these baseless folktales, can you?\" \"The merchants of Shenglu Hall have long left their obscurity and forgotten their past.\" \"Glittering Sand Crystal cannot easily be made into lacquerware, after all, nor is it suited to making luxury paints.\" \"According to the miners at The Chasm \u2014 and mind you don't believe this story too readily either\u2014\" \"This timepiece and sand crystal came from the Millelith five hundred years ago.\" In the lightless abyss where light wrestled against darkness, even one with a Yaksha 's might could not hold out for long. And all the more did mere mortals need light to prevent them from getting lost in the steel curtain of devouring night. The Millelith thus collected glowing sand to light the way, and it just so happened to resemble the pale moonlight. The timepiece for its part told of the time they spent there in the abyss, and serves as proof that where they fell, others have come after to take up their duty.",

The lightning pierced the deathly shadow, and thunder dissolved the darkness. The clouds hid the abyss, maw stretching to devour the firmament. The wild wind howled, the cinnabar sweeping the darkness. The mountain ranges shock, and the gorges caved in. The depths cried out as they collapsed, and then all was silent. The dense clouds solidified sundown-light as the perching birds sang sadly: \"Do you not hear? The drums die in the north wind, the hero sinks into the vortex.\" \"Have you not seen?

Thus it was said that to seek the silent and gentle Viridescent Venerer, one simply need to close one's eyes and walk barefoot through the forest , following the subtle fragrance of wild flowers. Only those who could tread as softly as a hunter could avoid making the leaves crackle underfoot, alerting the queen of hunters to their presence.

For she knew that one day, she too would embark on a journey to the place where the souls of her prey rested. The Viridescent Venerer believed that at the end of her life, she would wake up from reality, and be reunited with the departed at an endless hunting ground. But she also believed that the moment her arrow pierced through the monster that had killed the boy, that endless hunting ground at the end of her life was gone from her grasp.

Legend has it that when the Viridescent Venerer walked barefoot on the fields, the grass beneath her feet would tell her what the birds in the trees could see, and the mud she trod on would tell her what the roots in the earth could hear. But it is said that ever since disaster struck, the grass and trees never spoke again. For the God of the Woods had died in the disaster.

Even after rejoining the humans and accepting her place as Viridescent Venerer, no one ever heard her say a single word. Similarly, no one ever saw her leave a single trace behind.

The queen of the grass and trees watched the world change quietly, remembering her earnest covenant with those who had fallen. \"Please protect this Khvarena for me, my companion, my friend whom I love.\" \"When we are gone, the mortals shall wander, lost, like infants newly taken from their swaddling,\" \"Fragile, yet sufficiently strong to conquer the wild winds, the searing flames, and their own imperfections.\" \"But that which I fear is not the disasters I can predict, but rather the chaotic darkness ...\" \"Only the evil of this darkness and the threat of 'death' can crush the buds.\" When the gilded sand had devoured the paradise of the past, the queen of trees and grass arose to fulfill that ancient agreement. Heeding the will of the Khvarena, she created for her a beauteous form, fashioning for her a life that was lovely beyond compare\u2014 That was Simurgh , the divine bird, in whose form could be seen the vivid hues of countless birds, and in whose song was the song of numerous flowers... The final dream of the oasis was gathered into one body, and transformed into the pure, bright, endless sea of flowers hidden within the divine bird's body.",
        "Feast of Boundless Joy": "After the mistress of the orchard passed, the queen of grass and trees cut ties with the sea of sand . Forsaking mad love and majesty, she chose to return to the rainforest and take up the path of defending life... Thus did new life emerge from the forest, thus did the sages make a stir, and thus was a home fashioned. Wild fantasy leads to inexorable death, and the metaphor of death cautions mortals. The Khvarena of the flowers were born of the most exuberant of banquets and the purest of delights, And within them was not to be found the tartness of asceticism, or the rank stench of authority. Her final fate was inescapable death, to wither and dry up... Only the Lord of Wisdom could learn from such, so as to properly safeguard and use it. \"But do not forget my great mistress's prophecy, for it was she who sent me unto you.\" \"Folly shall yet not kill mortals, but the wild tide of darkness from beyond this world will sweep all away still .\" \"I am the final remnant of my mistress. I am the floral essence that cleanses all.\" \"Should I join with the purest water, I shall burst, even as the pomegranates do, into countless rays of light.\" And thus was the divine bird Simurgh born from the Khvarena of the flowers, Staying by her master's side for a time before flying to the flowery sea...",
        "Heart of Khvarena's Brilliance": "\"My dear friend , you who were so wise, yet passed early...\" \"Amidst glorious legends lurks the gloom of oblivion,\" \"Just as life walks with death, and forgetting is the lover of remembrance .\" \"If the darkness of death did not threaten it, no life would have any importance.\" \"If the waves of forgetfulness did not surge against them, there would be no histories worth recording.\" In the age long past, the queen of grass and trees once did as her friend had entrusted, Granting the Khvarena of flowers to the divine bird's form, giving her charge over the defense over a part of the rainforest. And just as the fate of the fresh flower is to wither, Simurgh's fate was sacrifice. The nurturer of all things verdant had known this since the night she slept beside the lord of flowers... \"And so the verdant divine bird blossomed into countless Khvarena flowers, scattering across the land like hoopoes...\" \"The Khvarena fell upon the pure remains of the Amrita's mistress , and thus was a glimmering sea of flowers born.\" \"Many spirits dwell in the sea, and they carry the wishes of grass, tree, and dew, cleansing all filth.\" \"Many spirits dwell in the sea, and they sing of the three mothers \u2014 of verdure , of sweet dew , and fresh flowers .\" One night, the daughter must leave the embrace of the three mothers, And sacrifice herself, for the impurity of the world grows great...",
        "Stamen of Khvarena's Origin": "\"My innocent daughter, my Khvarena...\" \" I shall give you unto another mother . Love her, and be loyal to her.\" \"She is no less than I, and her light is yet more radiant than mine.\" \"I once encountered a faceless nightmare in my dreams, and it frightened me to no end.\" \"And so I separated you from my body, and I ask you now to prevent that nightmare's coming.\" \"My Khvarena, the light of my eyes...\" \"I once warned her of the coming of the dark tide, and it is from this that your destiny arises.\" \"Please do not be afraid, and do not flee, do not let your Khvarena dim, and do not disgrace your mother.\" \"Just as it is my fate to sacrifice myself for mortals, so too is sacrifice the beautiful prelude to new life...\" \"Go now, into your verdant mother's embrace. You shall find your destiny in her realm.\" \"My Khvarena, my pure daughter...\" \"You shall change utterly. You shall face the trial of division and death.\" \"And after that, you shall become immortal \u2014 and yet that shall be a harder road still...\" \"The lord of sweet dew and the lord of grass and trees shall precede you in losing their divine forms...\" \"They shall be forgotten, and only the memory of your sacrifice will be remembered.\" \"My Khvarena, daughter of flowers...\" \"If you are resolved to not retreat out of fear...\" \"Then throw yourself into the embrace of your new mistress.\"",
        "Vibrant Pinion": "In a time no one remembers, the night before the sandstorm of tragedy swept through paradise ... The flowers and the trees once spoke of the mortal realms, their hopes, and their desolate future. The ones who must not be approached brought about the gray death , and the dark tide ravaged the raw river banks, Only for the newborn plants and beasts to unite with mortals and push the rolling sinister waves back. In the lonesome years after she had broken off ties with the lord of the red sands , the queen of grass and trees forged Khvarena into a divine bird , Charging her with the protection of two worlds, with the guardianship of the border between new birth and death. The divine bird lived amongst the pines, the cypresses and the snow-lotuses, and slumbered in dreams that recalled a time when the covenant still endured... It was only when disaster came that she awakened, and went to her inevitable doom. Later, just as that person had prophesied sadly, the deathly, silent gloom would permeate the rainforest... Just as that covenant fellow had warned, the tides of dark beasts swarmed forth and swept through the newly birthed forests... The former leader of the realm of water was slain amidst the upheaval, and her body was transformed into a sea of pure dew, the Amrita, And yet even that pure sea would dry up in a desolate land destroyed by the Abyss . Yet the mistress of grass and trees had no time to mourn, for the mother-tree of numberless seeds needed to be nurtured... To cleanse the dark impurities and ensure the purity of the Amrita, Simurgh would shatter its divine form\u2014 \"All beautiful things born from the Khvarena of flowers must face their fate \u2014 to wither and fall into the mud,\" \"And once they have withered, they shall be reborn, nourished by the Amrita, as beings of the flowery sea, no longer troubled by such things as 'death.'\""

    "Wanderer's Troupe": {
        "Bard's Arrow Feather": "An azure arrow fletching that has survived the test of time. The fletching seems to produce a tune as the arrow flies through air. The harpist of the troupe was also a skilled archer. Legend has it that he could lure the birds in the sky with his harp and shoot them down with his arrows. It is said that he never looked at the sky while he was playing the harp to lure the birds. Some believed the reason was his harpist's arrogance [ sic ], while his companion said it was his hunter's mercy. The ill-fated birds became the fletching of the harpist's arrows, and the sound of the harp became the birds' elegy.",
        "Concert's Final Hour": "The troupe's hourglass, which is also a harp. The tune becomes deeper with the passage of time. When the performance was coming to an end, the troupe would play this harp. As time passed, the tune of the harp became deeper. The sound of the harp dying down marked the end of the show. Everything has an end, and the troupe was no exception. One by one, each member of the troupe met their fate and their instruments were buried deep in the dust. As the harp fell silent, the final sound heard from the musical troupe was the faint trickle of sand as it slid down the hourglass one final time.",
        "Conductor's Top Hat": "A beautiful top hat untouched by time. Listening closely, one can almost hear an ancient tune echoing inside the hat. Thousands of years ago, a troupe wandered through the lands. The troupe owned not a single shred of sheet music. What they saw was what they sung, and what they heard was what they played. As time passed, the troupe gradually realized the vastness of the world. \"There are so many things in the world for us to sing of.\" The members then turned the notes into words and recorded their journey in a book. This book, The Widsith as they called it, was still held tightly in the conductor 's hands even after his death.",
        "Troupe's Dawnlight": "A small flower-shaped insignia. There seems to be music coming from it. Among the members of the troupe was a charismatic swordswoman . Beautiful as the light on water, elegant as the chirping lark. Her every slash hummed a tune of the wind. The end of each song and dance was like the sun after the rain. Dust has since settled, and both the stage and life itself feel emptier for the absence of her music. Both her music and her sword were as lethal as they were beautiful. This was in keeping with the troupe's performances, which were intended for two very different audiences. For the audience of foes, the music drifted far beyond the stage.",
        "Wanderer's String-Kettle": "A strangely-shaped kettle that plays a wondrous tune as the water flows out. There was always music in the life of a Troupe member, even when drinking water. An ancient tale tells of a wandering troupe that roamed the land. For flutes they had swords, and for harps they had bows. They performed not only for friends, but also for foes. They traveled through the desert and set foot in the blazing Mare Jivari . The tune of the harp echoing in the kettle was a reminder for them. \"Along with the boundless tunes we walk.\" \"Wherever there is music, there is us.\""
